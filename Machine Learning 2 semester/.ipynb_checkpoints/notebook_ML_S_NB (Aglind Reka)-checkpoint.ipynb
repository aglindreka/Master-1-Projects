As far as commercialization, that is\\n>a long ways off.  ...\\n> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this\\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n  \\n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude\\nwhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude \"In conjunction with its major\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\n  \\n>Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?\\n   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for\\nsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL\\nSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.\\n   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going\\nstudies trying straighten out the government\\'s future space\\ntransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)\\nare providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are\\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\\narchitecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced\\nvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,\\netc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy\\nfor future US gov\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against\\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\\nlike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.\\n   It\\'s a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn\\'t\\nthat there aren\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\\nthe near term.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\\nJewish scriptures.\\n\\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\\n\\n\\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\\n\\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\\n\\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\\n\\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\\nHebrew! :-)\\n\\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \\n\\n\\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\\n\\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\\n\\n\\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\\n\\t-- and Jonathan, Saul\\'s son, loved David intensely\\n\\n\\t[ I\\'m using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\\n\\t  don\\'t yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\\n\\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\\ntranslator goes!)\\n-- \\nMichael L.

In many cases they consented, although they or their\\nfamilies are not of the Baptist faith.\\n\\nThe baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including\\nPaulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls\\nwho were baptized without her knowledge or consent.\\n\\n'My understnading was they were going to a carnival.  I feel that's a\\nfalse pretense,' said Lamontagne.  Her daughters said the minister\\ntold them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not\\nbaptized.\\n\\nCornerstone church officials defended their actions.\\n\\n'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded\\nus to baptize converts.  No one can show me one passage in the Bible\\nwhere it says that parental permission is required before a child is\\nbaptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist\\nChurch.\\n\\nChurch officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized\\nbecause 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said.\\n\\nMany other parents also felt they were simply sending their children\\nto a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were\\nmembers of the Cornerstone Church.\\n\\nPolice said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the\\nchildren, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------\\nAren't these the same behaviors we condemn\\nin the Hari Krishnas and other cults?\\n\\n[I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account\\nmentions.  First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is\\nabsolutely required.  This would be extremely difficult, because of\\nthe clear commandment to obey parents.  But if an older child insisted\\non being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing\\nto do it.  However this would be a serious step, and would warrant\\nmuch careful discussion.  The problem I find here is not so much\\nparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you\\nbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign\\nof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from\\n*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of\\nthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is\\nlikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from\\na baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he\\nwould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already\\nhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.

[....]\\n\\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \\'hacker\\'\\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, know what \\'hacker\\' means from those who consider\\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\\n\\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \\'a UNIX\\n     hacker\\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  See {cracker}.\\n\\n     The term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\\n     project.\\n\\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  So,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (This means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\\nto communicate.

Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of \\nbestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask \\nthis gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people\\'s sexual preferences?  \\nWhat happened to \"No doubt I am free to do anything\"?  I think you have a \\nserious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between \\nhomosexuality and bestiality as \"slimey\" and \"sleazy\", you are making an \\nimplicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, \\nunnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about \\nhomosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any \\nsincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even \\nhave their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them \\nall of being mere \"jokers\"?\\n\\nI notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only \\nBiblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical \\nprohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament \\npassages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none \\nthat condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian \\nhomosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any \"clear\" New Testament \\nstatements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian \\nzoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament \\nmakes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?\\n\\nI am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically \\nacceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply \\nthe same standards to everyone else\\'s declared sexual preferences as well.  If \\nthe arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual \\npreferences as well, I\\'m going to apply them and see what comes up.  I\\'m not \\ntrying to \"torpedo a serious issue\" by using what you label \"a ridiculous \\njoke\".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines \\nfor Christian sexuality, and I don\\'t think such a question is \"irrelevant\" in a \\ngroup called \"soc.religion.christian\".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and \\nbestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good \\nprecedent for doing the same.\\n\\n>Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\n>the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\n>love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\n>ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\n>in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nI don\\'t know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a \\nside issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging \\npeople to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine \\nwhether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New \\nTestament that \"God has joined together\" heterosexual couples, and that the \\nmarriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual \\nintercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under \\nthe Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards \\nof defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the \\nsexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don\\'t think it\\'s \\nright to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to \\nChristians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn\\'t.  \\nThat was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different \\nexamples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong \\nto apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. \\n\\n>Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\n>corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\n>old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\n>even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\n>the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\n>manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\n>emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\n>taking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nIt was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don\\'t \\nget all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual \\norientation; I\\'m afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar \\nattitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with \\nchild abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of \"clear\" NT \\ncondemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation \\n(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on \\nalt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.\\n\\n>Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\n>WHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\n>condemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\n>to BEFORE you start your condemnations?

I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you \\nyourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find \\nbestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in \\nconnection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply \\nall the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply \\nthem to homosexuals?\\n\\nIs it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at \\nthe thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of \\nhomosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially \\nunacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  \\nDo you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual \\nmorality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible \\ncondemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality \\nthan it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality \\nwith homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer \\nthis question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many \\npeople feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.\\n\\nAlso please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely \\npointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that \\nthe Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think \\nadultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love \\nmy neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and \\nunmentionable, are you disobeying \"repeated orders not to judge or condemn \\nothers\"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you \\nand judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same \\noffense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible \\nbrands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?\\n\\n>For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\\n>evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\\n>rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*\\n>show a sinful shunning of God\\'s light.

If you mean that Jesus \\nis the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I \\nagree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our \\nsalvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, \\nand we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ\\'s grace mean that those \\nwho refer to sin as \"sin\" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking \\nin general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible \\ncalls something \"sin\", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it \\nsin too.\\n\\nAs applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on \\nChristian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible \\nsays on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every \\nverse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and \"unclear\" at best.  \\nThe most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some \\ndispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as \\ncondemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most \\npositive thing you can say about the Bible\\'s treatment of homosexuality is that \\nsome verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That\\'s it.  Jesus declared all foods \\nclean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to \\nkeep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from \\nbeing an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian \\npractice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination \\nthat defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you \\nhave some verses which are at best \"not clear\" but which some people believe \\n*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that\\'s the sum \\ntotal of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.\\n\\nI can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything \\nsimple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and \\nthose-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your \\ncase as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don\\'t believe it says \\nanything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving \\none another, and not judging one another, but that\\'s not really the issue, is \\nit?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for \\nChristians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  \\nTherefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  \\nEven if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still \\nleft with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about \\nhomosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who \\nare under the law and those who are not.\\n\\n- Mark\\n\\n\\n[Actually I don\\'t think the reaction to the comparision with\\nbestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards as\\nslimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and\\nbestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical\\napproach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding on\\nChristians.  The argument is that there\\'s no way in the text to\\nseparate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  This\\ndoes not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nor\\ndoes it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that their\\nsexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not from\\nLev.  --clh]\\n',\n",

Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from\\n>the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,\\n>Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.\\n\\nso sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it\\'s\\n sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine?\\n\\n [my stuff deleted]\\n >We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\\n >does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\\n >U.S. or even the U.N. involved?

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

This is very important.\\nAnyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality\\ndeals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there\\nis no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and \\nis \"holy, just, and good\" as is written in the New Testament, then\\nthose who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts\\nto be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.  \\n\\nWhy must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human\\nadult relationships?  Isn\\'t that bordering on sophistry?  The point\\nwe are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts.\\nNot everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional\\nargument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors.\\nThe issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.  \\n\\nI do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member\\nof the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is \\nthe sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after.\\nSo other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. \\n\\nAnd the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationships\\nbetween adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay \\nfor adults to  have caring relationships with one another.\\n\\nLink Hudson.\\n',\n",

I realize it is \\n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\\n> are the other reasons?\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.

I define \"faith\" as \"belief in the absense of any proof\", BTW.\\n\\nAlso, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types\\nthere, so in answer to your question: \"no.\"\\n\\nFinally, I\\'d hardly call Christianity \"beseiged\" in this country. I seldom\\nsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing\\ncrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don\\'t know for sure, of\\ncourse, I only say I haven\\'t seen it happening. What I have seen happening\\nis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people\\nwho claim to be Christ\\'s followers. I know that this sort of thing isn\\'t\\npracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority\\nwho are doing it and I don\\'t see comperable victimization of Christians. \\n\\n>Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting\\n>atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group?  \\n\\nThe implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I\\'m not a\\nstudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and\\nLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications\\nI see are improper, please let me know.\\nI\\'m here because I\\'m not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as\\nyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don\\'t_\\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\\n\"atheist\" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn\\'t deserve\\nyour respect?\\nAw, geez. I\\'m sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\\nhere. It\\'s just that the \"nonsense\" thing really annoys me. I figure you\\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\\nyour question.\\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That\\'s why I came to my university. Yes, I\\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\\nI\\'ve been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don\\'t\\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\\nmotives here all you want (hence the \"amatuer\" psychology crack), but\\nwithout an atheist, you can\\'t be sure of even one atheist\\'s motive.       \\nI\\'m hoping people really\\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\\nactually think about these things. Instead, I\\'m still faced with the\\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only \"broken\"\\npeople are atheist.\\n\\tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \\ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn\\'t\\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \\n\"breaks\" people.\\nIt\\'s an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\\nreason I\\'m here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \\na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\\n>I have a \\n>difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something\\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n>about the subject.     \\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe implication here being that atheists can\\'t possibly know anything\\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\\natheists are \"broken\", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\\nelse believes it. \\n\\n>\\n>Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says \\n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\\n>he will need to be proven wrong about it. \\n\\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\\nlack of existence. However, I haven\\'t met the strong atheist yet who said\\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a \"seeker\" if you like, I\\ndon\\'t. \\n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say \"I\\ndon\\'t believe in any god\" rather than my position: \"I believe that no\\ngod(s) exist.\" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\\nbecause they don\\'t actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\\nsomething (followed up by \"everyone has faith in something\"). Guess what?\\nMy atheism ends the moment I\\'m shown a proof of some god\\'s existence. Is\\nthat really too much to ask?\\n\\n\\n>Well, I don\\'t even waste my time trying. \\n\\nWell, I guess you won\\'t succeed in converting him or me. Why the\\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is\\nit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) \\n\\n> I tell him that he\\'ll just have to take my word for it.\\nAnd I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that\\nI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.\\nI have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that\\'s how I\\'m \"broken\"?\\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\\nyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a\\nfundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you\\nthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion \"God exists\". Logical or\\nphysical proofs only, please. Then we\\'ll discuss the nature of \"God\".\\n\\n>In response, he tells me he will say an \"atheist\\'s prayer\" for me. \\nPrayer?! Uh, oh, we\\'ll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :)\\n\\n>Good luck, Bob.  And, best regards.\\n\\nGood luck to you, as well.

As I\\'ve stated over and over,  I\\'ve checked\\nout about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private\\nlibraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey\\ntoo came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will\\nfind that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were\\nhighly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of\\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \\n\\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\\neven to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in\\nCorinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it\\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\\nseven hills?\\n\\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don\\'t even\\nhave to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. \\nWhere did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two\\ntails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from\\nan earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the\\nchurch of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\\n\\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the\\nscriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information\\nfrom all the various sources and put them in one binding.

Faith is a possible response to hearing God\\'s word preached.  Kids\\n   are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\\n   respond to God\\'s word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\\n   be raised in baptism to a new life.\\n\\nCatholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that\\'s\\none primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism\\nproduces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any\\nvolitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby\\'s\\nsoul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have\\nwithout Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his\\nintellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.

THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.

Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot.

When you encounter references to Heaven\\nin terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do\\nnot suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden\\nstreets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the\\nconcept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that\\nabout the \"fires\" of Hell?\\n     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the\\nlast description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the\\nFerris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant\\nby Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this\\nconnection, there are two reasons that occur to me.\\n     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as\\nsomething that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as\\nany rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --\\nbut the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS\\nSHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with\\nmatches).\\n     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word \"Gehenna,\"\\none of the words translated \"Hell\" in the New Testament. It refers\\nto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a\\nplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)\\nto Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires\\nburned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.\\n\"To be cast into Gehenna\" or \"to burn in Gehenna\" thus became a\\nmetaphor for \"to be rejected or discarded as worthless.\"\\n\\nLest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart\\nis my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT\\nDIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no\\nflames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most\\nbookstores and libraries.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n',\n",

Image annotation software\\n=============================\\n\\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn\\'t normally stored\\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\\n  rasterfile.\\n\\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford\\'s InterViews distribution) can handle some\\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\\'m not\\n  sure exactly what they are.\\n  You can ftp the idraw\\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\\n\\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

Some restrict the term\\'s meaning to \"active male\\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \\nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \\nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\\n\\n                      *************************************\\n\\n                                   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \\nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\\n\\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\\nministry. \\n\\n\\nFootnotes:\\n_______________________\\n 1.  For convenience sake, the term \"homosexual\" is used to encompass both\\nsame-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of\\nthe main considerations of this study.\\n 2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn\\n(Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it\\nis a \"term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent.\" \\nUnknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and\\nstudy.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral\\nEpistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie,\\nNew Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive\\ndiscussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).\\n 3. For example, see Scroggs\\' influence on M. Olson, \"Untangling the Web,\" The\\nOther Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition\\nof homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, \"Unconvering the Father\\'s Skirt,\"\\nVT 30/1 (Jan, 1980) 38-43.  For a bibliography of other sources dealing with\\narsenokoitai, see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes (NY: H.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!\\n\\n- end -\\n     \\n',\n",

In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to\\nlife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what\\nthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in\\nfavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise\\nsolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and\\ndeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This\\nis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own\\ndecisions (within reason).  And for what it\\'s worth, I am reasonably happy\\nwith current UK abortion law.\\n\\nSimilarly, the situation in what\\'s left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and\\nI really can\\'t see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don\\'t even\\nknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n',\n",

She said\\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\\nchange...but I shouldn\\'t have married to person in the first place )\\nand more....\\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\\ncounsel.\\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\\nwith whom we come in contact.\\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\\npeople. (wouldn\\'t kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)\\nIt is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer\\nlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.\\nThink about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that\\na friend is in error, but you don\\'t want to \"cause trouble\".\\nRighteous prayers is great power, but don\\'t forget that we are\\nwe are Christ\\'s lips and hands on earth. Don\\'t be afraid to\\nsimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it.

And those of us who are fighting for the right to life\\nof the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or\\ncrime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God\\nhas entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.\\n\\n\\nTHE IMPRECATORY PSALMS\\n\\nEarly in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for\\njudgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to\\nrespond to them. Prayers such as:\\n\"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for\\nhis wickedness ...\" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the\\ngospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly\\nmotivated by love for God (\"The Lord is King for ever and ever;\\nthe nation will perish from His land\" 10:16, and \"Why does the\\nwicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who\\nsuffer (\"You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You\\nencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the\\nfatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,\\nmay terrify no more.\" 10:17-18)\\n\\nNevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such\\ngraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: \"Pour out your\\nwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them\" 64:24; \"O\\nLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O\\nJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.\"\\n95:1-2; \"Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them\\nvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The\\nrighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe\\ntheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, \"Surely\\nthe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who\\njudges the earth.\\'\" 58:6-11\\n\\nCertainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply\\ndestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray\\nfor God to \"pour out His wrath\" on the wicked?\\n\\nThe scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be\\nprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.\\nRather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against\\nHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these\\nimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and\\nwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who \"boast of evil\"\\nand \"are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots\\ndestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise\\ndeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than\\nspeaking the truth.\" 52:1-3; \"They crush your people ... They\\nslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.\" 94:5-\\n6; \"With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot\\nagainst those You cherish.\" 83:3; \"You hate all who do wrong. You\\ndestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the\\nLord abhors.\" 5:5-6.\\n\\nTo those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:\\n\"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5;\\n\"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who\\ngo on in their sins\" 68:21.\\n\\nAnd the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then\\nit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\"\\n59:13; \"to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow\\ndown to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows\\nthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear\\nthat is due You. \" 90:11\\n\\nYet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include\\nimprecations (prayers invoking God\\'s righteous judgement upon the\\nwicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.\\nHowever, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much\\nmore common.\\n\\n\\nPRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS\\n\\nAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I\\nfound the survivors of communist persecution including the\\ncrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to\\nstrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.\\nI was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven\\npray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge\\nthe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation\\n6:10).\\n\\nThe initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino\\nNeto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had\\nbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.\\nHe boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won\\'t be a Bible or a\\nchurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet\\ndespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is\\nnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.\\nNeto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in\\nMoscow.\\n\\nIn Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded\\nof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:\\n  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be\\n     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.\\n  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles\\n     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be\\n     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in\\n     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was\\n     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal\\n     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.\\n  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a\\n     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car\\n     crash the very next day.\\n  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on\\n     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to\\n     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted\\n     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,\\n     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to\\n     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded\\n     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would\\n     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against\\n     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building\\n     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.\\n     \"They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord\\n     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the\\n     Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20\\n\\nNicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the\\npersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and\\nexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the\\nantiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was\\nin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of\\nRomania.\\n\\nAnother persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora\\nMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel\\nwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in\\nthe 1960\\'s. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would\\ndestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly\\nMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in\\nMozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and\\npadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,\\nsome being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles\\nwere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,\\nincluding many pastors and elders, were shipped off to\\nconcentration camps - most were never seen again.\\n\\nA month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly\\nand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him\\n(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were\\nspecifically praying for God to stop the persecution in\\nMozambique, Machel\\'s Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent\\nthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa\\'s\\nboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans\\nfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and\\npublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,\\nbut He had also saved a country from persecution.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in\\nZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27\\nyear socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on\\n31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to\\nChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected\\npresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian\\ncountry.\\n\\nIt is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,\\ndeclared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox\\'s\\nprayers than of an army of ten thousand\".\\n\\nOn 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African\\nCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented\\ninternational wave of condolences and adulation reported one\\ncould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a\\nmartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ\\nJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa\\nthis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.\\n\\nThe stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people\\nwere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective\\nconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of\\nthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other\\nvictims. Indeed the SA government, the international community\\nand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported\\nover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans\\nmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were\\nunbanned!\\n\\nYet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,\\nDeputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC\\'s \"military\\nwing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani\\nhad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many\\nunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword\\nwill die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.\\n\\nAfter personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities\\nat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly\\ndeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser\\nArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs\\nand limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told\\nhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn\\'t hate him, I did\\nhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either\\nbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God\\nwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he\\nwas an atheist.\\n\\nSeveral other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani\\nto repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in\\nAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against\\nunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck\\ndown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,\\nwithin months of these public prayers for God to stop these\\nkillers of preborn babies.\\n\\nSome praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:\\n\"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror\\nto evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any\\nChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -\\neven of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory\\nprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did\\nour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).\\n\\nWhat then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?\\nShould we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I\\nwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War\\nPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory\\nPsalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and\\nReformed Publishing Company):\\n\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly\\nin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the\\nOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT\\nare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50\\ntimes. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.\\n\\n\\n1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?\\n\\nSome Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as\\n\"devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God\\n\\'s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of\\na man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus\\'\\nteaching that we should love our enemies. \"\\n\\nYet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:\\n\"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,\\nrebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the\\nman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \"\\n(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).\\n\\nThe fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our\\ncomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its\\ninspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil\\nis to impudently take the place of God.\\n\\nDo we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God\\nhave led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made\\nit their job to \"clean up\" God\\'s Word according to their own\\nideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone\\nwho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for\\nHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the\\nauthority of God\\'s Word (like Eve\\'s original sin of listening to\\nSatan\\'s question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").\\n\\nThe Psalms are part of God\\'s revelation of Himself and His\\nattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the\\nauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these\\nevangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\"\\nfor the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about\\nHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles\\nused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb\\n4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.\\n\\nCH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially\\nPs 109):\\n\"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage\\nwhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in\\njudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would\\nspeak to us therein. \"\\n\\nThe rejection of any part of God\\'s Word is a rejection of the\\ngiver of that Word, God Himself.\\n\\n\\n2. Who is praying these Psalms?\\n\\nChrist quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually\\nspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an\\nenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer\\nbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at\\nthe Last Supper.\\n\\nOn the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient\\nauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own\\nwords - the words of the Lord\\'s Anointed - which as David\\'s Son\\nHe truly was.\\n\"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5\\n\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1\\n\\nIn His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on\\nthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!\\nMatt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, \\'I never knew you. Away\\nfrom me, you evildoers\\'. \" Ps 6:8\\n\\nIn Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ\\nalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said\\nthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22\\ndirectly to Christ despite there being no record of His having\\nspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed\\nChrist is speaking in the Psalms.\\n\\nChrist came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in\\nall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again\\nto execute Judgement on the wicked.\\nDavid as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a\\nprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:\\n\"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the\\nresurrection of Christ. \"\\nDavid was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in\\nhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah\\nspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by\\nChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His\\nforerunner David.\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of\\nGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion\\nfor the wronged.\\n\\n\\n3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?\\n\\nChrist is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for\\nour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with\\nthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for\\nwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the\\nsubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah\\n53).\\n\\n\"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we\\nmight become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21\\n\\nIn history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have\\nbeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St\\nAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.\\nAll the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the\\nimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord\\nJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is\\nonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy\\nHis enemies.\\n\\nThese prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of\\nKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God\\'s Word is revealed\\nupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God\\'s way of\\nforgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses\\nof God.\\n\\nHe who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a\\nreality when He declares to those on His left:\\n\"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared\\nfor the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41\\n\\nAll the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God\\'s\\nKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone\\nwill reign forever!\\n\"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a\\nsharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule\\nthem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of\\nthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \"\\nRev 19 : 15\\n\\n\\n4. Are Jesus\\' prayers contradictory?\\n\\nWhat about Jesus\\' command to love our enemies and to bless those\\nwho curse us (Matt 5:44)?\\n\\nChrist is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives\\nsin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement\\non those who disobey His Gospel.\\n\\n\"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you\\nand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when\\nthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His\\npowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel\\nof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting\\ndestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from\\nthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in\\nHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have\\nbelieved. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10\\n\\nJesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on\\nearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see\\nboth the vengeance and the love ot God.\\n\\nEven in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.\\n\"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of\\ngreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You\\nbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \"\\nMatt 23\\n\\nIn Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His\\nbetrayal by Judas.\\n\\nWe also need to acknowledge that Christ\\'s prayers of blessing are\\nnot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only\\npraying to the elect of God - those who have:\\n\"obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God\\'s Word ... and have\\n\"believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the\\nmessage of God\\'s kingdom will be judged.)\\n\\n\\n5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?\\n\\nMartin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy\\nName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all\\nthe opposition to this in one pile and say: \\'Curses, maledictions\\nand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May\\nthey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and\\nwisdom and plans run aground\\' . \"\\n\\nTo pray tor the extension of God\\'s kingdom is to solicit the\\ndestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of\\nheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it\\nwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it\\nwill itself endure forever. \"\\n\\n* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for\\nthe kingdom of darkness. *\\n\\nThere is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church\\ncannot exclude hatred tor satan\\'s kingdom from its love for God\\'s\\nkingdom. God\\'s kingdom cannot come without satan\\'s kingdom being\\ndestroyed. God\\'s will cannot be done on earth without the\\ndestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of\\nevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism\\nwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights\\nof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.\\n\\nNote Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot\\ntogether\" against God and His people:\\n\"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O\\nLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and\\nJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like\\nrefuse on the ground. \"\\n\\nThe story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)\\nprovides a vivid example of God\\'s judgement on the wicked. Sisera\\n\"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they\\n\"cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those\\nprayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by\\nthe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...\\nAll the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \"\\nJudges 4:15-16\\n\\nThe account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the\\ntent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety\\nand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The\\nsong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of\\nthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is\\nthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As\\nyou did to Sisera ...\"\\n\\n\\n6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:\\n     \"If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,\\n     which are written in this book, and do not revere this\\n     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord\\n     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He\\n     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you\\n     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also\\n     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not\\n     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are\\n     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...\\n     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be\\n     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \"\\n     Deuteronomy 28:58-63\\n\\nThe covenant God made with His people included curses for\\ndisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27\\nrecords the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in\\nan awesome account:\\n\"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud\\nvoice:\\n\"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing\\ndetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman\\'s hands - and\\nsets it up in secret. \"\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \"\\n\"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...\\n\"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour\\'s boundary stone...\\n\"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...\\n\"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the\\nfatherless or the widow...\\n\"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...\\n\"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent\\nperson.\\n\"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by\\ncarrying them out.\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26\\n\\nThe New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of\\nrejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the\\nLord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22\\n\\n(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-\\n31; 12:14-29.)\\n\\n\\n7. How can we preach these prayers?\\n\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.\\nScripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-\\nin-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on\\nthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we\\nexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the\\ntroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the\\nstrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not\\nhear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him\\nonto the battlefield?\\n\\nPastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church\\'s\\nCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job\\nis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain\\nand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general\\'s orders.\\nThe pastor\\'s charge is of greater importance than that of a\\ncourier in any earthly army. There\\'s no place tor the dispatcher\\nto decide he doesn\\'t agree with his Commander\\'s strategy.\\n\\nWhen Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching\\nmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God\\'s Kingdom (Lk\\n10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God\\'s\\nrule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on\\nany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected\\nit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we\\nmust consider what He said they should do if their message were\\nrejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against\\nGod\\'s rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go\\ninto its \\'streets and say, \\'Even the dust of your town that\\nsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:\\nThe kingdom of God is near\"\\' Luke 10:11.\\n\\nWhat would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it\\nwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent\\nfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that\\ntown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,\\nBethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message\\n(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great\\nauthority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to\\nMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects\\nhim who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor\\ncalling down God\\'s curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion\\nagainst God\\'s authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of\\nHis servants.\\n\\nWe need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the\\nPrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its\\nlethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on\\nthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks\\nwill be inevitable.\\n\\nLike Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of\\nobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is\\nthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he\\nreap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in\\nDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings\\n6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant\\nbreakers is real.\\n\\nThe \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms\\nincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our\\nown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The\\nPsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record\\nChrist\\'s march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As\\nChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final\\nfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will\\nanswer the psalmist\\'s prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the\\nfinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when\\nHe will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be\\nKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\"\\nLuke 19:27.\\n\\nA fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to\\nobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war\\npsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God\\'s\\nkingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by\\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local\\ncongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your\\nbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword\\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle-\\nreadiness also involves \"pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions\\nwith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.\\n\\nChrist teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the\\nenemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the\\nnations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not\\ncall on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.\\n\\nTo deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it\\nis necessary for us to pray for God\\'s justice. Those who are\\npersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.\\n\\n\"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the\\npraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in\\ntheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment\\non the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles\\nwith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against\\nthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps\\n149:5-9\\n\\nPrayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for\\nconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement\\non those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army\\nof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He\\nhas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people\\nnf God to destroy evil.\\n\\nIf you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or\\nundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword\\nanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of\\nJesus - until \"the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as\\nthe waters cover the sea\" Hab 2:14.\\n\\nThe full book \"War Psalms of the Prince of Peace \" is available,\\nat R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.\\n\\n\\nPERMISSION TO REPRODUCE\\nThose wishing to reproduce or quote from any edition of FF News\\nare encouraged to do so.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\\n\\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\\nwith one\\'s aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can\\'t\\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\\nfrom the *duty* to marry one\\'s brother\\'s childless wife.\\n\\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\\nof understanding why.\\n\\nP.S. Please don\\'t bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\\nYou don\\'t know whether I am homophobic or not.

DeYoung\\n\\nW. Petersen\\n\\n     More recently Wright\\'s understanding has itself been questioned from a\\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\\nconfusion in using the English word \"homosexuals\" as the meaning of\\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\\nrendering it by \"homosexuals\" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\\n\\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\\n\"homosexuals\" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  \"A\\nmajor disjunction\" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\\nthought and terminolgy in Paul\\'s time (187-88).\\n\\n      What is this \"disjunction\"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \\nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \\nChristianity simply added the categories of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" in\\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\\n\"homosexuals\" and \"heterosexuals,\" and assumed that, in the words of Dover\\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, \"everyone responds at different times to both\\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . .\" (188). [23]\\n\\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term \"homosexual\"\\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\\nequivalent to \"homosexual,\" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\\naffectional preference and having \"nothing to do with sexual acts\" (189).\\n\\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the \"Supplement to the Oxford English\\nDictionary,\"  which defines \"homosexual\" only as a propensity or desire with no\\nmention of acts.  Petersen\\'s point is that by using \"homosexuals\" for\\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\\n\"where no equivalent concept existed\" (189).  Consequently the translation is\\ninaccurate because it \"includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\\nfemale homosexuals\" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no \"cognitive structure,\\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\\nhumanity into \\'homosexuals\\' and \\'hetersosexuals\\' made sence\" (189).\\n\\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\\n\"homosexual\" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen\\'s position.\\n\\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY \"HOMOSEXUALS\"\\n\\nHistorical Grounds\\n\\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\\nby \"homosexuals\" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul\\'s\\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\\npresent-day concepts.  \\n\\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \\nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under \"Linguistic Grounds.\"\\n\\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \\nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\\n\"Symposium\" (189d-192d) may be a \"sole possible exception\" to ancient\\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\\nhere \"acts appear to be the deciding factor.\"  However, this is a very\\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called \"an exception,\" because of\\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\\n\\n     THe \"Symposium\" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon (\"man-woman\"). Hence \"original nature\"\\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\\n\\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \\n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \\n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\\n    clasped in men\\'s embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\\n    to man\\'s estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \\n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \\n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \\n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \\n    induced to leave each other\\'s side for a single moment.  These are\\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\\n\\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each \"would\\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\\nthe time:  (192e).\\n\\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  \"Natural interest\" (ton\\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \\nThe words, \"born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \\n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims \"to\\nbe born this,\" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (\"the two of them\\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,\" 192b) is\\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of \"mutual love ingrained in mankind\\nreassembling our early estate\" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (\"These are\\nthey who continue together throughout life,\" 102c) is also present.  Further\\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, \"gay pride,\" pederasty,\\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\\nrecognizable.\\n\\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \\nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its \"desire\" and \"passion\"\\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or \"matters\" of love (187c), the\\ndesires of love (192c) and being \"males by nature\" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for \"what is not\\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.\"  This is\\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between \"what\\nsort of being is love\" and the \"works\" of love (201e).  This ancient\\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\\n\\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\\nlatter. [27]\\n\\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as \"reasoning,\" \"heart,\" \"becoming foolish,\" \"desires\\nof the heart.\" and \"reprobate mind\" prove Paul\\'s concern for disposition and\\ninclination along with the \"doing\" or \"working\" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \\nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\\n6:9-11) by words describing what people \"are\" or \"were,\" not what they \"do.\" \\nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\\n\\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\\n\\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\\n\"new labels\" of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for sexual behavior.  These did not\\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,\\nPlutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]\\n\\nLinguistic Grounds\\n\\nfootnotes\\n___________________________\\n22  W.L.

Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Harvard Univ, 1978) 1 n. 1.\\n24    We are conscious of the fact that Plato\\'s writings may not reflect\\nAthenian society, or that the speakers in \"Symposium\" may not reflect Plato\\'s\\nview.  However, it is assumed that they do, and with this agrees Dover\\n(Homosexuality 12) and other evidence cited below \\n25 The translation is that of W.R.M. Lamb, Plato:  Symposioum LCL (Cambridge:\\nHarvard Univ, 1967) 141-143.  Note the reference to \"adulteress.\"  If there is\\na homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes, logically there must\\nalso be an adulterous conditon derived from birth.\\n26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love\\nthe male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young; \\nthe latter should be outlawed (181d-e).  Such love of youths is to be permanent\\n(181d), lifelong and abiding (184a).  Where homosexual love is considered a\\ndisgrace, such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the\\ncowardice of the ruled (182d -an early charge of \"homophobia\"?).  In Athens it\\nwas \"more honorable to love openly than in secret\" (182d -an ancient expression\\nof \"coming out of the closet\").  Mutality was present (\"this compels lover and\\nbeloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue,\" 184b).\\n    For Petersen to label the Symposium a \"possible\" exception to his position\\nis inadequate and misrepresentative.  It is a significant witness to Greek\\nsociety hundreds of years before the time of Christ.\\n27 Dover (Homosexuality 12, 60-68) finds homosexual desire and orientation in\\nPlato\\'s works (Symposioum and Phaedrus) and elsewhere.  Philo writes of those\\nwho \"habituate themselves\" to the practive of homosexual acts (The Special Laws\\n3.37-42; cf. De Vita Contemplativa 59-63).  Josephus says that homosexuality\\nhad become a fixed habit for some (Against Apion 2.273-75)  Clement of\\nAlexandria on Matt. 19:12 writes the \"some men, from birth, fhave a natural\\naversion to a woman; and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well\\nnot to marry\" (Miscellanies 3:1)  It is addressed in Novella 141 of Justinian\\'s\\nCodex of laws (it referes to those \"who have been consumed by this disease\" as\\nin need of renouncing \"there plague,\" as well as acts).  Pseudo Lucian (Erostes\\n48) and Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon II.38) speak of it.  Finally\\nThucydides 2.45.2 has: \"Great is you glory if you fall not below the standard\\nwhich nature has set for your sex.\"\\n     Boswell (Christianity 81-87) cites poets (Juvenal, Ovid), witers\\n(Martial), statesmen (Cicero), and others who describe permanent, mutual\\nhomosexual relationships, even marriages.  Even emperors could be either\\ngay-married (Nero) or exlusively gay (Hadrian), Boswell says.  Scroggs\\n(Homosexuality 28, 32-34) admits that both inversion and perversion must have\\nexisted in the past.  He discusses possible references to adult mutual\\nhomosexual and lesbian relationships, but dismisses them (130-44).\\n28  See specifics in S.R. Driver A critical and Exegetical Commentary on\\nDeuteronomy (Edinburgh:1895) 250.  He observes that the prohibition of\\ncross-dressing in Deut. 22:5 is not a \"mere rule of conventional propriety.\" \\nSee also Dover, Homosexuality  73-76, 144.\\n29  Plato in his last work, in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuous\\ncitizen, condemned pederasty and marriage between men as \"against nature\" (para\\nphosin)(Laws 636a-b;  636c;  836a-c; 838; 841d-e).  According to TEST.NAPH\\n3:4-5 the sodomites changed the \"order of nature.\"  THe Jewish writers, Philo\\n(On Abraham 135-137) and Josephus (Ant. 1.322; 3.261, 275; Ag. Ap. 2.199;\\n2.273, 275) label sexual deviation as \"against nature.\"  Finally,, first\\ncentury moralist such as Plutarch (Dianlogue on Love 751c-e; 752b-c) spoke of\\nhomosexuality as \"against nature.\"  Christians clearly did not invent the\\nlabels \"natural\" and \"unnatural\".

If anything, one could claim that,\\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \\nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\\n\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\\n\\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\\nsalvation from death in a lion\\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\\'s\\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\\'s transformation into a beast, a story that\\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\\nmartyr\\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\\n\\nZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from\\nMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The\\netymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,\\nas uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-\\nwhere. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the\\nGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old\\nIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,\\nseveral Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\\nWe can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,\\nmeans \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used\\ntraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when\\nZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into\\ncommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books\\nof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]\\n  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in\\nWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,\\nand heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"),\\nattributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the\\nAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha\\nSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha\\nVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the\\nprophet\\'s death.\\n  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger\\nAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the\\nPahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid\\ninscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is\\nmentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who\\nseems unaware of him).\\n  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true\\nchronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect\\nway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose\\nwas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the\\nother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,\\nalthough from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him\\nsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,\\nHermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The\\naccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean\\nsix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes\\nagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes\\nreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut\\nHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it\\nis generally rejected.\\n  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are\\nnonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history\\nof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as\\nthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time\\nZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an\\nextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet\\ncould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close\\nto, that of the Achaemenids.\\n  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-\\nlogy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-\\ning to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\\nAgain, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as\\nhistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical\\njustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the\\nlatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface\\nbecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed\\nby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra\\'s lifetime roughly around the\\nbeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex\\nproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the\\npart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this\\ncontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after\\nthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and\\nVishtaspa\\'s conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium\\n(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\\n  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to\\nreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally\\non the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus\\nthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the\\ngreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of\\nthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that\\nperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same\\ntime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be\\njustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-\\nthushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the\\nmost legitimate.\\n  As to Zarathushtra\\'s land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of\\nvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that\\nhe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\\nwith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language\\nof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,\\nboth on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,\\neven though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable\\nvariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view\\nthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian\\nregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,\\nZarathushtra\\'s land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the\\nHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia\\n(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would\\nthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\\n  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna\\n33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a\\nspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned\\nreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an\\nathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly\\ncaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used\\nto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the\\nproduct of a great and original ethical mind.\\n  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India\\nto Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,\\nor \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks\\ntruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -\\nand blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision\\nof asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the\\n\"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this\\nlanguage lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian\\nmysticism.\\n  Zarathushtra\\'s greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a\\nparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength\\nof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-\\nfully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic\\nmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the\\nevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,\\nFrashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] \\n  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological\\ndoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra\\'s teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-\\ntions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic\\nand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem\\nof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward\\nreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-\\ntion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\\n  Another original facet of Zarathushtra\\'s message, one that is not easy to\\nunderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the\\ncomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the\\nAmesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the\\nabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous\\ndevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a\\nsystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the\\nmanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]\\n  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"),\\nand of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of\\nZarathushtra\\'s life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\\nAccording to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at\\nthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful\\ninspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did\\nhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was\\nstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly\\ngroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility\\ncaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of\\nKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with\\nhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two\\nyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"),\\nand of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more\\nsons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of\\nhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good\\ncattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:\\nFrashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi\\'s father, and the latter as the\\nhusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"),\\nwhose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,\\naccording to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was\\nassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the\\nTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi\\nform).\\n  The paucity of information on the prophet\\'s life is compensated by a tradi-\\ntion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian\\ncommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of\\nthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as\\npassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth\\ncentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i\\nBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about\\nZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the\\nperfect man.\\n  Zarathushtra\\'s great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the\\nRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic\\nperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien\\nwisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,\\npsychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the\\ninfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always\\nopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and\\nadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as\\na precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the\\nbiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural\\nsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three\\nMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is\\nderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the\\nFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the\\nSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the\\nspread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra\\'s popularity in the\\nChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised\\noften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three\\ngreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture\\nand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-\\nance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-\\nthushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was\\nviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean\\nOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a\\npossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in\\nVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\\n  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and\\nnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave\\nthe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-\\n1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the\\ntrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between\\ngood and evil.

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

Let\\'s consider some \"personal interpretations\"\\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\\n\\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\\n\\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\\n\\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\\nexamining McConkie\\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\\n\\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\\n\\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title \\'Elohim\\'...\" (Articles of Faith,\\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\\n\\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\\n\\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\\n\\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\\n\\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\\nMcConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\\n\\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\\n  Messianic prophecy?\\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\\n  David\\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\\n  unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The\\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\\n  sit on my right hand forever.\\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\\n\\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\\n\\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\\nwhich reads:\\n\\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\\nthe Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\\n  Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\\n  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:\\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\\n  Messiah, p. 532)\\n\\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and\\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\\n\\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\\n\\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\\n\\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\\nwill be considered in this examination.\\n\\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\\n\\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\\' role in\\nChrist\\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\\n\\n        Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps.\\n        110:4.\\n\\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\\n  says: \"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for\\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\\n  p. 450)\\n\\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\\n\\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\\n     (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\\nhim [Christ]...\"\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\\nverses.\\n\\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\\nthese Scriptures:\\n\\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\\n\\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\\n\\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\\nthe Messiah.\\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\\n\\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\\n\\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\\n\\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy. \"The\\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\\n\\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\\n\\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\\n\\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\\n\\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\\n\\n        Now, what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\\nScriptures prove this fact:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\\n  beside me there is no God.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\\n\\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah\\'s\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\\n5:27)\\n\\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\\nBible reveals that \"Elohim\\'s\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\\n\\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...\\'Elohim,\\' is the literal Parent\\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\\n\\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\\nman\\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\\ntruth about who created man.\\n\\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\\n  him_.

(Jer. 38:16)\\n\\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\\n  made_....\\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on \"souls...I\\n  have made\" added)\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\\n  from the womb_.\\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things...

(Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\\n  all things that in them are.\\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\\n  Abraham\\'s writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: \"We will\\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\\n\\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\\n\\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\\n\\n        Regarding the Mormon \\'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\\n\\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\\n\\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\\n\\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\\n\\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\\n  developed....\\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\\n  Father, and to him only....\\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\\n\\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\\n\\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\\n\\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\\n\\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\\n\\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\\n\\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\\n\\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\\n\\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\\n\\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\\n\\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\\nidolatry.\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens.

(Josh.\\n  24:15-16)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\\nand all therein.\\n\\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\\n\\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim\\'s\" covenant\\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim\\'s\" of\\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\\n\\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\\n\\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\\nworld to redeem mankind.\\n\\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\\n\"Jehovah.\"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons\\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\\n\\n        In answer to Jesus\\' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\\n\\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\\n\\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\\n1)\\n\\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\\nThe Bible says:\\n\\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\\n\\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\\n\\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\\n\\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\\n17:3)\\n\\n  \"...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you.\" (Ju. 2:3. See also\\n  Exod. 23:32-33)\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This is basically\\na share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk:\\nwhat God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.\\nIt makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers\\nof any possible creature.  This is the \"everlasting life\" that the New\\nTestament speaks of.\\n\\nWhat Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying\\ngrace to the human race.  He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\\n\\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it\\'s impossible for a\\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither\\ncan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.\\n\\nThis all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since\\nboth have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot\\nenter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they\\ncannot enter into Heaven.\\n\\nTurning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the\\nCatholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some\\nchange in an infant\\'s soul, there is no particular reason to insist on\\nthe practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the\\nApostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly\\nthereafter.\\n\\nThere is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1\\nCor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known for\\nsure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an\\ninfant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his\\nmartyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as\\ninfants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus\\'s \"Against\\nHeresies\", and in Tertullian\\'s \"On Baptism\".  All these so far\\nmentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord\\'s death.  After\\nthat, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.\\n',\n",

For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\\nby itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.\\n\\n\\tPaul F.

I have had\\n>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.\\n>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?\\n \\nCertainly. Reference follows. \\n\\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow\\n>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour\\n>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is\\n>sufficient interest\\n\\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nChris Lilley\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \\nManchester, UK.

Why is it that, if a person\\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \\n\\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\\n\\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\"\\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\\ncomputer industry?\\n\\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\\n\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"       |\\n|  \"Szechuan Death\"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\\n|                             |            \"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\"|\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n',\n",

Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Since it hasn\\'t\\nbeen posted for some time (and I\\'ve modified it somewhat since the\\nlast time), I\\'m taking this opportunity to post it.  There is another\\nentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.  They\\ncan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as\\npub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.  It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

(If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nmean homosexual.  Here\\'s what he says: The two Greek words that appear\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.\\n\\nMany people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug\\naddiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s OK.\\nMost of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people\\nget angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be\\nattraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if\\nwe view it as wrong) wouldn\\'t be different than any of these other\\nthings.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or\\nanother having to work to overcome bad habits and particular\\ntemptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say\\nthat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus\\nsaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying\\nto self (which also appears throughout Paul\\'s letters) seems to\\nsuggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we\\nare called on not to accept.  Paul\\'s letters and the experience of\\nChristians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and\\nthe battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that\\nhomosexuality is difficult to fight doesn\\'t necessarily say it\\'s OK.\\nMaybe this isn\\'t the place where we have to die to self.  But I\\'d like\\nto make sure that those who think it isn\\'t are fighting the battle\\nsomewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have\\nto fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.\\n',\n",

I took me a long time to come\\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\\nsome \\'rosicrucians\\' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.\\nThere is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people\\nwho call themselves \\'Hindus\\' or \\'Christians\\' or \\'Pagans\\' and actually\\n*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important\\nrequirements about not belonging to other \\'religions\\'.  I find that\\nthe ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be\\ninterpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that\\n\\'mysticism\\' is the core of every religion and Huxley\\'s \\'Perennial\\nPhilosophy\\' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>\\n\\n\\nTony:\\n\\nI\\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nCertainly true.  I didn\\'t know there WERE any groups which called themselves\\n\\'Rosicrucians\\' that didn\\'t associate with AMORC.  Sure, I\\'ve heard all the\\nhubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these\\nWestern esoteric groups, but hadn\\'t heard about other \\'Rosicrucians\\'.\\nI\\'ll admit my bias.

I\\'ve met some of these Rosicrucians and have\\na couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I\\'ve heard and the slight contact\\nI\\'ve had with them does not give me the hope that I\\'d be received with\\nany kind of warm welcome.

Matthew 25 talks about \\nthe eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations\\n20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are\\nthrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and\\nthe fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where\\na fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that\\nthe devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the\\nMatthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the\\npunishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or\\nin the sense of continual. \\n \\nFrom Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,\\nif it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living\\nforever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the \\nunbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on\\ncontinually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.\\nIt definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid\\nregardless of its exact nature. \\n\\nThere seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:\\nWhat is God's main plan on earth?\\nWhy is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed\\nto simply destroying completely those who refuse God?\\n\\nI believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship\\nwith people.\\n\\nThe nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more\\ndifficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something\\nto avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has\\nnothing to do with God.\\n\\nIn the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of\\nhell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,\\nit is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can\\ncontinually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or\\nwhether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is\\nburned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a\\nphysical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,\\nat some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is\\nno longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,\\nthe unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell\\ni.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical\\npain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are\\nto be forever without God. \\n \\nThe Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener\\nthink in physical terms in order to get the point that some people\\nwon't listen to God even after he rises from the dead.

These people -- and those associated with them\\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\\n    ties; but that doesn\\'t mean other, more faithful people could not\\n    have this blessing.\\n\\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\\n    before then.\\n\\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\\n    ets.

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \\nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \\nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \\nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \\nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \\nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \\nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \\nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \\nstandards.\\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa\\'s FlickerFree(tm) technology, \\nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \\ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \\ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \\nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \\noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \\nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \\ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is \\nalso offering this card in the \"TurboBahn\" combination packaged \\nwith their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.\\n        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, \\nWINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance \\nvalue.  Genoa\\'s advanced proprietary drivers act to \"turbocharge\" \\nthe chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with \\npower and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced \\nchip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and \\nreliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D \\nStudio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.

I don\\'t often see the attitude of\\n\"forgive me and I will try to change\".  Instead I see \"there\\'s nothing\\nwrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who\\nhave an illness because you don\\'t accept me\".  Christians can and will\\naccept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.\\n\\nSure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it\\nis also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born with\\na desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  It\\'s\\nmuch less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in\\nanger.  There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful\\ndesires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church\\nwhen they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after\\nseveral years.\\n\\n-- \\nDarin Johnson\\ndjohnson@ucsd.edu\\n    \"Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the things a particle can\"\\n',\n",

At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous\\n    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near\\n    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part\\n    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They\\n    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became\\n    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle\\n    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby\\n    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were\\n    visible till morning sunrise.\\n\\n    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in\\n    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in\\n    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was\\n    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.\\n    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a\\n    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about\\n    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the\\n    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop\\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\\n    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\\n    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\\n    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still\\n    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.\\n\\n    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket.

Many different observations, including IRAS\\n> and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures\\n> can range from 40K to 150K.\\n\\nInterstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\"\\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\n\\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\\nby any conceivable observation.\\n\\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\n\"average\" temperature.\\n\\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\n\\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\\nAllen\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.

It states\\nclearly that the visitors were angels.  But \"all the men from every\\npart of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the\\nhouse.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to \\nyou tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex \\nwith them.\\' \" \\n\\nFor the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men\\nof Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21\\nthat the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before\\nthe angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sin\\nof Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears that\\nthe men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had\\ngroup orgies in the public square--which simply indicates \\nthe extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser \\ndegrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us\\nbelieve.\\n\\nUltimately our understanding of God\\'s will for sexuality comes from\\nthe creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  He\\ncreated us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship\\nbetween one male and one female, \"Therefore a man will leave his\\nfather and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become\\none flesh.\"  This marriage relationship is the only sexual\\nrelationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and\\nprotects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture\\nof the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find not\\none word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between \\ntwo men, or between two women.\\n\\nEverything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from\\nor expresses God\\'s will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thus\\nthe Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest,\\nhomosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and\\nthe coveting of our neighbor\\'s wife; other commandments forbade rape.\\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and\\nperverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage\\nrelationship.  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural\\',\\nRomans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Paul\\'s opinion,\\nbut because it was contrary to God\\'s purpose in creating us\\nmale and female.\\n  \\nMichael> Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here\\nMichael> and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they\\nMichael> ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously\\nMichael> have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL\\nMichael> ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest\\nMichael> charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nMichael> manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they\\nMichael> suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss\\nMichael> our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what\\nMichael> it is.\\n\\nReally, have you no better response to `slander\\' than more\\nslander?\\n\\nDavid H.

In order for U.S.  industries to\\n>compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov\\'t\\n>has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)\\n\\nThis definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into\\nthe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow\\nI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea\\nwhich solves yesterday\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\nsomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, \\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\n\\nI believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\\n-- \\nHerman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399\\nPhone: (317)494-6054\\nhrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  \\n{purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)\\n',\n",

I only claim having done some \"homework\" :-)\\n\\n     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems\\ndifferent, it\\'s my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else.

I took me a long time to come\\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\\nsome \\'rosicrucians\\' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\\n\\n     I\\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\\n\\n     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they\\ndescend (at least in part) from what was the \"Gold-und-Rosenkreuz\" (Golden\\nand Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two \"Golden and Rosy\\nCross\", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with\\nMasonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).\\n\\n     \"You\\'ll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you\\'d probably have had a\\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \\n\\n>The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and\\n>that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars\\n>(English?) from the thirteenth century.\\n>\\n     Again, instead of R:s, it should be \"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\" :-). It\\nis curious to know that 3 other RC \\'orders\\' (in the USA) claim to be *non-\\nsectarian*.\\n\\n     The Cathars were a \\'heretic\\' christian sect that directly challenged\\nthe \\'authority\\' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the\\n12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the\\ncrusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the\\nworldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church\\'s\\nunseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern\\nItaly, then throughout the south of France.\\n\\n\\n>What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all\\n>contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,\\n>then that we couldn\\'t become divine as the persons we are currently,\\n>but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.\\n\\n     I don\\'t see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with \"us containing\\nsomething divine\"...

I think Michael is right in this, but\\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\\nof contention between Michael and myself. \\n\\nI have argued -- beyond Michael\\'s claims -- that the Christian\\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\\nthere is some \"right\" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\\ndetermine what that \"right\" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\\n\\n> Michael, and I, and others, read \\'the Bible\\' with Christian\\n> glasses.

He is willing to live and practice his religion\\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\\nimportance of this.\\n\\n> Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael\\'s\\n> theological positions, actually) didn\\'t tell him much about Christianity;\\n> Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): \\'What do you mean?\\' More\\n> direct, perhaps, would have been: \\'What could you possibly mean?\\'\\n> The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the tradition,\\n> is a failure.

The purely Christian\\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\\npolitical stances.  That one should love one\\'s neighbor is a \\npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \\nfor homosexuality is *not*.\\n\\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \\nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.

Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\\nnarcosis.

But I suspect\\nthe point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.\\nIndeed it\\'s going to be impossible to see what he was getting at\\nwithin your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians\\nare saved is at the heart of it.\\n\\nThe classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until\\nthe last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)\\nwas the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions\\nworshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a\\ncorollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and\\npossibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there\\'s no\\ntruth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are\\nintentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,\\nSatanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might\\ncontain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would\\nbe missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.\\nIf this is the background of your teacher\\'s remarks -- and I suspect\\nit is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily\\nrelevant.  The point is not that there\\'s anything intrinsically wrong\\nwith it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners\\nmay all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a\\nfollower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.\\n\\nThis is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.\\nChristianity says that salvation isn\\'t a matter of being kind and\\nnice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no\\none is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.\\n(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There\\'s a\\nCatholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in\\ndifferent terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible\\nways.  But if it doesn\\'t have Christ, it\\'s like a diet that consists\\nof food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some\\nessential food element so that you end up dying.\\n\\nLet me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.\\nWhat I\\'m trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is\\nnow relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other\\nreligions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an\\nunfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move\\nwithin Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental\\nGod.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow\\nanybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they\\nfind it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at\\nwork in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive\\nalternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis\\nfor the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a \"judging\\n   deity\".\\n\\n2. Reincarnation is not the same as being born again.\\n\\n3. Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body.\\n\\n4. Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings\\n   of Christianity about God, the fall, the being. incarnation, death,\\n   and resurrection of Christ, his coming again, sin, grace, forgiveness, \\n   salvation, and the last judgement.\\n\\n>Isn\\'t Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation\\n>among Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate them\\n>to the Christian scriptures?\\n>\\n>Jack Carroll\\n\\nOrigen\\'s work was mostly lost. He was not anathematized, to my knowledge, \\nbut his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies.\\nPerhaps someone else can comment on Origen.  I don\\'t know if there\\nis a specific statement about reincarnation from him, but from what I do\\nknow about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another.\\n\\nI don\\'t know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in\\nthe Church. However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II\\nfrom an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes\\nto go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he\\ncan relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance,\\nan anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and\\nAnthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an\\nactor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner\\nand based his acting and directing methods on Steiner\\'s indications.  Part\\nof the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,\\ngoing to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another\\nPolish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about\\nAnthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask\\nhim what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, \\n\"Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in \\nreincarnation,\" and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times\\nto modern times.  Then he changed the subject.

What\\'s\\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\\nenough by those who don\\'t believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\\n\\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\\n\\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\\n\\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \\ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\\n\\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\\nevangelist\\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this\\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\\n\\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion,\\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command\\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\\n\\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\\n[ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\\n\\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\\nhow it was said: \\'You must love your neighbor\\' and hate your enemy.  But I\\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\\ndoes NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the\\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\\nChristians.\\n\\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to\\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING\\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\\neven (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t\\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\\n\"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\\n\\n\\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\\n\\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\\n\\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\\n\\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\'\\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\\nour understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite\\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\\n\\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\\n\\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \\ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\\n\\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \\ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \\npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s\\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t,\\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\\nof the synoptic tradition?\\n\\nI\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into \\nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]\\n-- \\nMichael L.

He was\\n    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in\\n    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-\\n    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob\\'s wife\\tdied,\\n    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even\\n    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,\\n    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss\\n    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare\\n    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such\\n    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one\\n    looked upon an angel.\\n\\n    Mary\\'s greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-\\n    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved\\n    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her\\n    gender.  When\\tshe  once, early in March brought the first violet to\\n    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:\\n\\n    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-\\n    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes\\n    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in\\n    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-\\n    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be\\n    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to\\n    attract the public\\teye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in\\n    quietude and peace.\\n\\n    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the\\n    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,\\n    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which\\twas  beaming  in  the\\n    morning sun:\\n\\n    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem\\n     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-\\n    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:\\n    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure\\n    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the\\n    hardest\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;\\ttouch\\n    it\\tbut carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the\\n    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!\\n    Then pointing to a rose he said:\\n\\n     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More\\n    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to\\n    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure\\n    of\\theart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the\\n    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,\\n    as\\tshe  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.\\n    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with\\n    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least\\n    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and\\twan,  and  go\\n    before their time to the grave.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one\\n    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not\\n    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle\\n    of\\tthe garden. Mary\\'s father had planted it the day that she was\\n    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it\\n    blossomed  earlier\\tthan  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The\\n    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that\\n    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at\\n     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father\\n    and said:\\n\\n    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling\\n    of\\tred  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of\\n    flowers!\\n\\n    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes\\n    once  more\\tupon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the\\n    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all\\n    become  brown  and\\tyellow\\tand  when  the\\tsun came forth in its\\n    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter\\n    tears at the sight. Then said the father:\\n\\n    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my\\n    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced\\n    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree\\n    an\\timage of what would happen if you were to wander from the way\\n    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has\\traised\\tin  my\\theart\\n    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,\\n    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed\\n    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your\\n    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I\\n    should\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -6-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    go down sorrowfully to my grave.\\n\\n    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,\\n    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her\\n    mind that she never forgot them.\\n\\n    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and\\twise,  and  amid  the\\n    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-\\n    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring\\tas  a\\n    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.\\n\\n    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the\\n    fruits  of\\this  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how\\n    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect\\n    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his\\n    pious teaching and example.\\n\\n    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together\\tin  a\\n    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:\\n\\n    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one\\n    to\\tthe  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-\\n    dered still more lovely by being together. In  the\\tsame  way  my\\n    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and\\n    cannot be separated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought\\n    of the presence of God\\n\\n-- \\nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \\nViva Cristo Rey !!

But if you can contrive\\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\\n\\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\\n\\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\\nthoughts.\\n\\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\\ncommon by more than one person.  A\\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\\n\\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \\ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\\n\\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\\n\\nthanks very much\\n\\n*dt*\\n\\n========================================================\\n\\n.\\n\",\n",
       " 'From: aaronc@athena.mit.edu (Aaron Bryce Cardenas)\\nSubject: Baptism requires Faith\\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\nLines: 144\\n\\nIt troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support\\nthe doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no\\nother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its\\nsupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants\\nwill go to hell.\\n\\nIt\\'s very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of\\nscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the\\nheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically\\nbased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let\\'s now take a\\nmore complete look at scripture.\\n\\nColossians 2:11-12 \"In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of\\nthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been\\nburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the\\npower of God, who raised him from the dead.\"\\n\\nIn baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a\\npersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent\\'s faith cannot do this.  Do\\ninfants have faith?  Let\\'s look at what the Bible has to say about it.\\n\\nRomans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\\nIsaiah says, \\'Lord, who has believed our message?\\'  Consequently, faith\\ncomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\\nof Christ.\"\\n\\nSo then we receive God\\'s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\\ngospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God\\'s word preached.  Kids\\nare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\\nrespond to God\\'s word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\\nbe raised in baptism to a new life.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\\nguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\\nrighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\\nwickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\"\\n\\nIf you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn\\'t hold us guilty\\nfor anyone else\\'s sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:31-32 \"Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,\\nand get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?\\nFor I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.\\nRepent and live!\"\\n\\nThe way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids\\ncannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we\\nwill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.\\n\\nNow then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is\\nnot Biblical, let\\'s look at some of the scriptures used to support it.\\n\\nRomans 5:12 \"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and\\ndeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all\\nsinned--\"\\n\\nSin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to\\neach man because each man sinned.  Note that it\\'s good to read through all\\nof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than\\nothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all\\nsaying basically the same thing.  Let\\'s look at one such.\\n\\nRomans 5:19 \"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many\\nwere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many\\nwill be made righteous.\"\\n\\nThrough the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In\\nthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.\\nWe must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each\\nman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.\\nOtherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read\\nthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of\\nview to see if it doesn\\'t all fit together.\\n\\nPsalm 51:5 \"Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother\\nconceived me.\"\\n\\nThis whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves\\nbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God\\'s\\nown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and\\nmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can\\'t\\nremember a time when he wasn\\'t sinful.  He is humbling himself before God\\nby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is\\na hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn\\'t limited to a literal\\ninterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).\\nFor another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\\n\\nNow then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that\\noriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is\\nnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with\\nother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.\\n\\nCertainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling\\nis always that they don\\'t know any better.  Let\\'s look to see if the Bible\\nagrees with my gut feelings.\\n\\nIsaiah 7:14-15 \"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The\\nvirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him\\nImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the\\nwrong and choose the right.\"\\n\\nNow just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy\\nabout Jesus.  If they don\\'t, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new\\nleader.  Jesus certainly couldn\\'t have had less knowledge than normal human\\nbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent\\nbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that\\nhe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is\\nthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over\\nwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather\\nconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don\\'t know to choose\\nthe right instead of the wrong.\\n\\nJesus himself was baptized, albeit with John\\'s baptism, not as an infant,\\nbut as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as\\nsoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was\\ntempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).\\n\\nThank you for your attention.\\n\\nModerator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps you\\nwould like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it\\nfrom time to time when the topic comes up.  Feel free to rearrange the\\ncontents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nAaron Cardenas\\naaronc@athena.mit.edu\\n\\n[I think you\\'re overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of\\nyour response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.\\nIt was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in one\\nform or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,\\nsaying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is\\nan ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.\\nThe original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptists\\nstill hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants\\nwithout believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacraments\\ntend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants who\\nbaptize infants see baptism as a sign of God\\'s acceptance of us,\\nrather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestant\\ntheology, God\\'s grace precedes our response, and is applicable to\\nchildren.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate\\nthat God accepts even children.  --clh]\\n',\n",

Many young adults come there to search for meaning in \\ntheir life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a \\nsharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a \\nmonthly \"Johannine Hour\" which will be posted at the beginning of each \\nmonth. A \"Johannine hour\" involves a short commentary on a given Bible \\npassage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that \\nmay arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be \\nposted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less \\nin polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another \\nto deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own \\nlife-journey.\\n\\nThe idea of \"Johannine hours\" was born in Taize as a simple response\\nto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible\\'s message in the\\nmidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often\\nimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but\\neveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit\\nquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,\\nwe can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of\\nChrist.\\n\\nDuring the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we \\nunderstand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, \\nwe find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to \\ncommunicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening \\nthem with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought \\nus joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.\\n\\nPerhaps those who read and think about the \"Johannine Hours\" in this\\nnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.\\n\\nThe important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the\\npersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect\\nof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.\\n\\nBACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:\\n=================================\\n\\nThe following provides some background information on the life and\\nvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.\\n\\n\"A PARABLE OF COMMUNION\": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of\\nWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost\\nabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring\\ntogether a monastic community which would live out \"a parable of\\ncommunity\", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of\\nthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal\\nrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.\\n\\nAN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize\\'s founder spent the\\nfirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,\\nseven brothers committed themselves together to common life and\\ncelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each\\none making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.\\nToday, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant\\nbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are\\nliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North\\nand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for\\nthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no\\ncapital. The brothers earn their living and share with others\\nentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an\\ninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live\\nin the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming\\npeople in Taize.\\n\\nTAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and\\nless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since\\n1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have\\nthus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental\\nmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year\\nand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any\\none week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore\\nthe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner\\nlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to\\n6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and\\neverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church\\nof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too\\nsmall.\\n\\n\"A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH\" The community has never wanted to\\ncreate a \"movement\" around itself. Instead, people are called to\\ncommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,\\ntheir city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created\\nwhat it calls \"a pilgrimage of trust on earth\". At the end of each\\nyear, the pilgrimage has a \"European meeting\" which brings together\\ntens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for\\nseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia\\nand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open\\nletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the\\npoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages\\nand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.\\n\\nNOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in \\n       news.groups.\\n\\nFor any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk\\n\\n               brother.roy@almac.co.uk\\n-- \\n . 1st 1.10b #332 .

Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\\ncorrect.  That\\'s not arrogance.  That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\\nI have been so unthankful.  You\\'ve given me power to resist the devil.  I\\nhave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said\\nnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself\\nwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you\\'ve given me, I have been\\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I\\'ve led.  Lord,\\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I\\'m so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.

Considering \\nthe confusing spitting contest over \\'rights\\', (there are TOO \\ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \\nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \\nof my site.    (I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm. Hathaway \\nBaltimore MD \\n\\n\\n(P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, \\njust a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know \\nthat other people may not accept it without a complaint.)  \\n',\n",

In general,\\nmost folk can\\'t control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I\\'m not sure what\\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\\npart of that.\\n\\n>Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\\n>1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.

Unless you feel plagued by\\ndreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.\\n\\n>2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are \\'another plane\\')\\n>Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\\n>common by more than one person.\\nWhat on Earth is your definition of \"often\"? I know exactly one case of\\ntwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and\\nas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could\\nsee why their dreams might be similiar.

Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\\n\\nPS This was reprinted without permission.

Sex, or Christianity?\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:\\n\\n\\tWhat\\'s more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\\n\\tof other human beings?\\n\\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any \"flavor\" of Christianity\\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a \"priority\"\\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\\nthe dead bury the dead, to \"hate\" family rather than let it keep us from\\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in \"love\" of God.\\n\\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has \"taught\" that all sex\\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\\nvehicle of becoming \"one flesh\" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\\nfoster the children they beget and support their children\\'s mothers.\\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus\\' citation of\\nthat passage.)\\n\\n\\t[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\\n\\t  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\\n\\t  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\\n\\t  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\\n\\t  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\\n\\t  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\\n\\t  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\\n\\nYes, of course it sometimes goes \"wrong\" -- like all else we do, it is\\ninfected with sin, and you find married \"couples\" where there is no bond,\\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\\nformation (the \"infatuation\", \"falling in love\" phase) that they break\\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God\\'s grace\\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\\n\\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the \"proper\" preparation for an\\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\\nare human, and little good comes of trying to \"mortify the flesh\" to the\\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\\n\\n>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\\n>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\\n\\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\\non the part of those who find us \"stumbling blocks\" I am much less of\\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\\n\\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God\\'s creation, that can develop to\\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\\nspiritual endowments from God.

I doubt this will have much bearing on the\\n\\tarticle as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]\\n\\nThe hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and\\nb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The\\nquestions I wish to raise are\\n\\n\\t1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?\\nand\\t2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the\\n\\t     discussion) that it is correct?\\n\\nNote that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),\\nwhich seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the\\nliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,\\nPaul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless\\nyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound\\nmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-\\nate text to \"fix\" the coinage\\'s meaning for his audience.\\n\\nAs yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm\\nor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat\\nplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way\\nof construing this problem passage.)  I\\'m going to set aside for the moment\\nthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the\\nmore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,\\ntwo kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,\\nwe can look at the text of Paul\\'s letter for clarification or look outside\\nthat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to\\nderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul\\'s meaning.\\n\\nThe single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no\\ninternal evidence for Paul\\'s meaning.  He uses the word totally without an\\nexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of\\nnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.\\n\\nWe are left, as the only \"internal\" clue, with the etymology or formation\\nof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before\\nhim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with\\nother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (\"lie\" in\\nLeviticus, \"bed\" in Greek).  One problem is that \"bedders\" (_-koitai_) is\\nnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one\\nserious test which de Young\\'s hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:\\n\\n\\to  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much\\n\\t   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies\\n\\t   \"men who have sex with X\"  [obviously, the \"best case\" is to\\n\\t   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]\\n\\nsuch texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.\\nIt is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-\\nstandable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition\\nof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn\\'t *prove* the hypothesis\\ncorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or\\nnot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible\\nof comprehension by his readers.\\n\\nMy \"test\" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT\\nin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his\\nreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)\\nor to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that\\nthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.\\n\\nExternal evidence, that is, texts other than Paul\\'s own and lexicographic\\nor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into\\nthe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,\\nwhich *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by\\na contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-\\nality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one\\nhas grounds for\\n\\n\\to  denying that Paul coined the word\\nand\\to  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning\\n\\nDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his\\nreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and\\nits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young\\'s guess)\\nunderstand him to be referring to the Levitical \"universal\" prohibition\\nof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized\\nat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --\\nhow else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled\\nback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah\\nlaw to his gentile converts!)\\n\\nAmong the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined\\nthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or\\nIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be\\nassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than\\nusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What\\nis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?\\n\\nAnd if he *didn\\'t* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in\\nhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for\\nhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no\\nother.)\\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by\\nthis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,\\nhad a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and\\nexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of\\nevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.\\n\\nSo -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.\\nAnd it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.\\nI can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about\\nthe word:\\n\\n\\ta)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe\\n\\t    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities\\n\\n\\tb)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual\\n\\t    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their\\n\\t    part with the Leviticus passage)\\n\\n\\tc)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an\\n\\t    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not\\n\\t    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application\\n\\t    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER\\n\\t    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me\\n\\t    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I\\'m advancing.]\\n\\nOf these, I\\'d say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but\\nI still have reservations about that, too.\\n\\nIf the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence\\nof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul\\'s coining it.  If it does\\nappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior\\nuse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should\\nnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they\\ncan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In\\neither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul\\'s relation\\nto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be\\nfrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul\\'s relations are hardly straight-\\nforward!\\n\\nThere is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid\\nus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as\\ngood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).\\nBut it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don\\'t know about you, but I\\nfor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means\\nbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he\\nsays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this\\nsame character (Romans 14:22-23)\\n\\n\\t\"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and\\n\\tconsider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going\\n\\tagainst his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt\\n\\tis condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done\\n\\tin bad faith is a sin.\"\\n\\nFor my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul\\'s meaning in the use of\\n_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by\\nthe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty\\nof constraining Paul\\'s own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and\\nall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --\\nand sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you\\nto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul\\'s\\nwords HAVE led some people), then Paul\\'s intense communicative effort to\\ncontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.\\nI have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I\\nread him \"in the large\", if I can see him lay out his position in detail\\nand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his\\nmeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)\\n\\nIn my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first\\nof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm\\nthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as\\nthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-\\nthesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and\\nfor later Christians.

Any \"stigma\"\\nassociated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests\\nsolely upon the parents--they\\'ve committed a sexual transgression for\\nwhich they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations\\non him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the\\nparents\\' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS\\ntheology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the\\nsubsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of\\nMormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases\\nholds parents responsible for their children\\'s sins if they have\\nfailed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this\\npassage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).\\n\\nAlso note that there is no \"big genealogical book in Salt Lake City\".\\nThe LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains\\ncontaining (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,\\nbaptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I\\nmay be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2\\nbillion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is\\nbuilding up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there\\nsome kind of \"worthiness screening\" as to whether someone can be\\nentered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the\\nparents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.\\n..bruce..\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBruce F.

If you want the full document, ask me by mail\\n--Rex] \\n\\n\\n   \"Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner\\nconsciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ\\nbriefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any\\nessential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the\\nattributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would\\nmean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,\\nfree from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm\\nof the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which\\nwas not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the\\ndivine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,\\nnot in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human\\nnature.\\n     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the\\nhuman nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the\\nperson. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,\\nomniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited\\npower, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There\\nis, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more\\nshare the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential\\nperfection of the Godhead.\\n     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the\\npossession of the double natures.  Christ\\'s human nature is impersonal, in that\\nit attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the\\nGod-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the\\nMan. Nature is defined:\\n\\n\"the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental\\ncharacter, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and\\nunchangeable.\"\\n\\n     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such\\nthe Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. \\nPersonality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the\\npower of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature\\nof Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.\\n LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally\\nimportant to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as\\nsuch, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say\\nthat Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is\\ntheanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the\\nhuman and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will\\nare simply human or simply divine.\"\\n\\n\\n[The quotation given above is not identified, and it\\'s not entirely\\nclear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,\\nlet me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic\\nChristological heresies -- monothelitism.  That\\'s the position that\\nChrist\\'s two natures were not complete, in that there was only one\\nwill.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the\\nhuman will that was regarded as missing.\\n\\nNormally people who talk about Christ\\'s human nature as being\\n\"impersonal\" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they\\nare using \"person\" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of\\npersonality.  In this use, the doctrine is called \"anhypostasia\".\\nPersonally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of\\ndenying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never\\nbeen formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential\\ntheologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the\\nquotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,\\ninto the realm of the overtly heretical.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

The\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\n\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\n\\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\n\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\n\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\n\\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\nManagement System.\\n\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\n\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\n\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\n\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\npropulsion systems.\\n\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\n\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\\noperations costs, he said.\\n\\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\n\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\nattitude.\\n\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\n\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\n\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\n\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\n\\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\ncommand.\\n\\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\nAdministrator.\\n\\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\nhand-picked program office.\\n\\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\nelement of the current program.\\n\\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\n\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\n\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\nand ground operations.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\nbe held May 3.\\n\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\\n\\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\\ncarried on the schedule are:\\n\\nApril 26\\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\\n\\nApril 27\\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\\n\\nMay 3\\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nMay 15\\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\nJune 7\\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\\n\\n\\n(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)\\n \\n',\n",

This necessarily means that\\nour private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God\\nintended to convey.  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to\\ndetermine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us\\nrecognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically\\naccepted as the infallible interpretation of God.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\\n>should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\\n>-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\nThe story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity \\nto \"know\" the two men who were Lot\\'s guests; the fact that the Sodomites became \\nangry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they \\nwere interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was \\nrape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some \\nChristians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as \\nsinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it \\nwas that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended \\nrape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible \\nalternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those \\nwho believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying \\nto say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.\\n\\nYou seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the \\nfact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to \\n\"stigmatize\" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can \\nsee how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion \\nthat there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we\\'re not \\nsupposed to start from our conclusions because that\\'s circular reasoning.  If \\nGod is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more \\nprobably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites\\' \\nblatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I \\nwill document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises \\n*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.\\n\\n>>\"... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, \\n>>nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor \\n>drunkards, \\n>>nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such \\n>were \\n>>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\\n> \\n>The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\\n>in this.  \\n\\nThe moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church \\nas the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be \\nlegitimate, and thus the church\\'s refusal to recognize \"perverted\" marriages \\nwas circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the \\nchurch ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a \\nstraw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise \\ndefinition/translation of \"porneia\" isn\\'t really important, unless you are \\ntrying to argue that the Bible doesn\\'t really condemn extramarital sex.  I\\'m \\nnot sure the moderator was trying to do that.\\n\\nIn any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  \\nWhen Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, \"Have you not read, that He who \\ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, \\'For this \\ncause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and \\nthe two shall become one flesh\\'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one \\nflesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.\" (Mt. \\n19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife \\n(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of \\nheterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, \\nand not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this \\nunion, in Jesus\\' words, because it is not something created by men.\\n\\nThis is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God\\'s word.  I read in the \\nBible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any \\nsimilar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there \\nhave been uninspired men who have ordained \"alternative\" unions (isn\\'t Caligula \\nreported to have \"married\" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to \\nas \"what God has joined together\" is the heterosexual union of a man and his \\nwife.\\n\\n(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that\\'s probably inflammatory, and I \\nshould save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  \\nPlease hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of \\nmy reply.)\\n\\nAnyway, my original question was not whether we should translate \"porneia\" in a \\nway that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: \\ngiven that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as \\ndivinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of \\nmarriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we \\nneed to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You \\nseem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and \\nother sins) are really wrong:\\n\\n>>I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\n>activity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n>\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\n>or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\n>fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\n>all \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\n>in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\n>with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\n>Christian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nAlternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as \"porneia\" and all \\nthe rest was, in Paul\\'s day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the \\n\"tutor\" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen \\ncenturies drumming into the heads of God\\'s people the idea that things like \\nhomosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  \\nPerhaps Paul didn\\'t go into detail on what \"porneia\" &c were because after 1600 \\nyears he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the \\nreason God\\'s apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining \\na distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any \\nsignificant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  \\nI\\'ll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just \\nwanted to point out that the New Testament\\'s failure to develop a detailed new \\nstandard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about \\nsexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for \\npracticing homosexuality!\\n\\n>Homosexual behavior is no different.

How do \\nyou determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex \\ndrives?  Is the desire to have \"sinful\" sex an obsessively driven mode of \\nbehavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined \\nas sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that \\nthe person is driven to seek it even though it\\'s sinful.  Or is it obsessive \\nbecause it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that\\'s \\ncircular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even \\nthough society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is \\nobsessive.\\n\\nYou seem to be trying to limit the Bible\\'s condemnation of \"porneia\" to only \\n\"perverted\" sex acts, but I don\\'t think you can really define \"perverted\" \\nwithout falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.

When people start going on (as they do in this\\n>matter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\n>do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\n>arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\n>insects.\\n\\nPlease remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality, in part \\n2.\\n\\n>On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\n>say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\n>of the ritual law?\\n\\nI am glad you asked.  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual \\nintercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this \\nwould show that God\\'s condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual \\nlaw?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual \\nbehavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that \\nGod\\'s definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to \\njust the ritual law and those who are under the Law?\\n\\nI\\'ve been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the \\nsubject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping \\nrequirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to \\nrest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on \\nthe Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements \\nsuch as \"Thou shalt not kill\", and requirements that are merely part of the \\n(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.\\n\\nThe point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of \\nhomosexual intercourse as \"an abomination\" is *just* a part of the temporary, \\nJews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by \\nGod as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those \\nguilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here\\'s why:\\n\\nBack in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in \\nthe possession of \"the Amorite\"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don\\'t you think?  \\nBut in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  \\nit seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because \"the \\niniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete\".\\n\\nRemember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the \\niniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his \\nbeing cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 \\nagain.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, \\nhomosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, \"Do \\nnot defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the \\nnations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the \\nland has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so \\nthe land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these \\nabominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their \\npeople.\"\\n\\nNotice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of \\nMoses) are about to be punished because they have \"defiled\" themselves and \\ntheir land by committing \"abominations\" that include incest, bestiality, and \\nhomosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these \\nsame \"abominations\" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on \\nanyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man \"lying \\nwith another man as one lies with a woman\" (Lv. 20:13).  Their \\n\"bloodguiltiness\" was upon them, meaning that in God\\'s eyes, they deserved to \\ndie for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even \"the alien \\n[non-Jew] who sojourns among you\" was to refrain from these practices, on \\npenalty of being \"cut off [by God?] from among their people.\"\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the \\nclaim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not \\nthe homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list \\nsex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the \\nCanaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay \\nsex), I\\'d say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even \\nby those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.\\n\\n>For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\n>be \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\n>it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\n>determine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.\\n\\nAccording to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable \\nfor teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I \\nbelieve that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can \\nlearn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is \\na violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law \\n(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain \\nactions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I \\nconclude that God\\'s objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a \\nperson is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case \\nof homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling \\nabomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the \\nLaw as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that \\nGentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply \\nsaying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not \\nobligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to \\nour exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has \\ndeclared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.\\n\\n(continued in Part 2)\\n\\n- Mark\\n',\n",

If you would like more info on the ministry,\\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\\n\\n\\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\\n\\nby Malcolm Smith\\n\\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\\nthan God\\'s way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\\nat Kadesh and had God\\' s promise of one day entering the land. The\\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt\\'s gods as He led\\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What\\' s next on the miracle menu?\"\\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men\\'s lives had hung\\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God\\'s glorious\\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God\\'s love is not an emotion\\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\\nmother\\'s love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love\\'s excitement, a love\\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents\\' love is\\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents\\' love. It is a\\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God\\'s love will the rest of life\\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won\\'t\\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses\\' prayer was partially\\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man\\' s highest\\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\\n\\n\\n----- End Included Message -----\\n',\n",

       " 'From: ldiel@dante.nmsu.edu (Leisa Diel)\\nSubject: Info needed\\nOrganization: New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM\\nLines: 58\\n\\n\\n  Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an\\ninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions of\\nChristianity/churches there are.  \\n        My husband and I come from very different, but completely\\nChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a\\nborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot\\nof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical\\nbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.\\nHowever over the last year, I\\'ve been regretting changing to the\\nChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a\\nfundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are\\nsocio-cultural in nature and don\\'t relate to the Christian doctrine.\\nOne of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through\\nMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but\\nin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I\\nam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser\\nmember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that\\nverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in\\nanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men\\n(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw\\nwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college\\ngroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the\\nstudy.\\nAlso my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church\\nfeels that if you aren\\'t a conservative republican - you aren\\'t a REAL\\nChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call\\nthemselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to\\nlong prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are\\nalso don\\'t agree with the C of C\\'s dread of any new \"movement\" being\\nled by the young people.\\n\\nSo, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably\\nbiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter\\nwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).\\nChristopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious\\nconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still\\nbring their Bibles to service.\\n\\nWe are so confused here and we\\'re drifting around trying to find a\\nplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and\\nwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we\\'d be\\nthrilled!\\nI\\'m afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and\\neven harder for me to stay churchless for long.\\n\\nany responses would be welcome\\n\\n\\nthe diel family\\n\\n[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what\\nyou\\'re looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of the\\nflavor of the specific local churches in your area than the\\ndenomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sort\\nof narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.\\nHistorically that\\'s been associated with movements that have the\\ncharacter you\\'re trying to avoid.  --clh]\\n',\n",

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n',\n",

And the issue\\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\\n\\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\\namong the Greeks.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\\n\\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God\\'s word to the Jews in\\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\\ncourse, Anglicans don\\'t do so :-)).

That may or may not be true of the\\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\\n\"mainstream\" religion.\\n\\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\\ndoesn\\'t NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\\n\\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\\non non-Christians.\\n\\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\\n\\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\\nanything that\\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\\'d like to\\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\\n\\n\\n[7]  What\\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?\\n\\nMost people don\\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

A life like\\nthat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.\\n\\n>\\'Till I met the Man, that is.\\n\\nMy initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching\\nand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the \\'presence\\' of\\nGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once \"felt\" this presence\\njust as I had \"felt\" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a\\nlittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I\\nhad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as\\nsomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.\\n\\nSince then, I\\'ve never abandoned the possibility that maybe your\\nsupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in\\nmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for\\na moment and called out to whatever\\'s out there, because I want to\\nknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I\\nhave not yet received an answer.\\n\\n>= Only when I truly listened to myself, body and soul, did I realize\\n>= that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being\\n>= Christian.  There is a higher truth in the universe, and Christianity\\n>= just ain\\'t it.\\n>\\n>Any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be, and why?\\n\\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\\non this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-\\ndimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck\\nin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables\\nbecome too much for us to even speculate on.\\n\\nThat is, there\\'s no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to\\nbe, so there\\'s no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor\\nhad anything to do with it.\\n\\n>\"OK,\" you may say. \"So now, if I\\'m just being good, am I doing good enough?\"\\n>\\n>That\\'s for you to answer.  If you feel you\\'re doing fine, then go ahead and\\n>ignore us foolish little Christians.  We can present what we\\'ve seen and\\n>experienced (providing our witness), but it isn\\'t up to us to make that seed\\n>sprout.  \\n\\nChristians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy\\nbook, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt\\ntrips, insinuations that I\\'m without morals, arguments from disbelief\\n(\"how can you possibly believe that God *doesn\\'t* exist?\"), and so\\nforth.  All I\\'m asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,\\nbut it\\'s not going to be easy.\\n\\n>So much as you don\\'t like what we\\'re \"selling\", there just may be someone\\n>out there that can identify with it.  Methinks you could give us all a \\n>lesson in tolerance and back off.\\n\\nHaving had years upon years of contact with your religion from both\\nthe inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It\\npreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it\\'s\\ngot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly\\nintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you\\'ll say\\nthat your religion doesn\\'t teach that -- but I\\'ve got to judge\\nChristianity from the Christians I know.\\n\\nI feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one\\'s\\nself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason\\nthan that.\\n\\nSo I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some\\npeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly\\nvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity\\nwhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to\\nrealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,\\nfulfilled life.\\n\\nI have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice\\nthings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses\\nis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and\\nthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to\\nbelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think\\nany less of people who don\\'t agree with them.\\n\\n>Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the\\n>Christian\\'s faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we\\n>propose otherwise.\\n\\nPrecisely my point.  You\\'ve still not given me a reason to be a\\nChristian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem...\\n\\n>= The nice thing about religion, if you lose yourself deeply enough in\\n>= it, is that eventually you\\'ll be able to feel justified in most\\n>= anything you want to do.\\n>\\n>Y\\'know your right.  Fortunately for everyone around me, I\\'m not religious.  \\n>I\\'m a Christian.\\n\\n... just as the Moslems aren\\'t religious, and the Buddhists aren\\'t\\nreligious.

Given that I\\nam not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist,  i'll have to boil it\\ndown a bit.\\n\\n1)  ALl the data on bursts to date,  shows a smooth random distribution.\\n\\n2)  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores, our or someone\\nelses.\\n\\n3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLY\\nlarge phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomena\\nbeing subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena\\n\\tOR\\nwe are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needs\\nsome potent little energy source,  that isn't detectable  by any other\\ncurrent methods.\\n\\n4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  because\\nwe have no parallax measurements on the bursts.\\n\\n5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or\\nsuper string  impacts or something like that.\\n\\nSo everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.\\n\\nwhat i am wondering,  is this in people's opinion,  A NEW Physics problem.\\n\\nEinstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.   \\n\\nCopernicus,  started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion.\\n\\nIs this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics?\\njust a little speculative thinking folks.\\n\\npat\\n\",\n",

How do you (Mormons) reconcile\\n>the idea of eternal marriage with Christ\\'s statement that in the ressurection\\n>people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?\\n\\nWell, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a\\nsimilar question.  I hope it helps:\\n\\n[Begin repeat of previous post]\\n\\nAs for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a \\nproblem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  \\nLuke\\'s version has Jesus saying that the children of this world \\nmarry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain\\nthe kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies\\none for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I\\nthink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let\\'s have a\\nlook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable\\nideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,\\nMark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.\\n\\nWhat happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the\\nresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to\\nthe \"Leverite\" marriage which required the brother of a man who died\\nwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  \\nThe children would be considered children of the deceased, just as\\nthough the woman\\'s first husband had fathered them.  It seems\\nobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be\\nthe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a\\nscene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to\\nfather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite\\nmarriage was equal to the first for they ask, \"Whose wife shall she\\nbe in the resurrection?\"  At this point it seems obvious that if she\\nis anybody\\'s wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she\\nborne children they would have been credited to him regardless of\\nwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was\\nrefering to this when he says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the\\nscriptures or the power of God.\" (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,\\nphrase not in Luke\\'s account).\\n\\nAnyway, the Sadducees ask, \"Whose wife will she be in the\\nresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?\"  Jesus answer is that,\\n\"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in\\nmarriage...\" (Mat 22:30) \"When they rise from the dead they neither\\nmarry...\" (Mark 12:25)  \"They which are accounted worthy to obtain\\nthat world neither marry...\" (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to\\nsay, \"but are as the angels in heaven\" or the equivalent.  I find\\nthis last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels\\nnor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim\\nthat they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no\\nBiblical support for this.)\\n\\nI think what Jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in Matthew\\'s\\nand Mark\\'s accounts) is that marriages will not be performed in the\\nresurrection.  This goes along with our belief that if a person is\\nto marry at all it must be done on this earth.  However, we do\\nbelieve that a marriage performed by the authority of God can be\\nbinding in eternity.  In fact, the first marriage appears to have\\nbeen performed by God himself before death entered the world (in the\\nGarden of Eden).  What therefore God hath joined together, let not\\nman put asunder. (Mat 19:6)  Jesus also told Peter and the other\\napostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound\\nin heaven (Mat 16:19, 18:18).  I believe that this also refers to\\nmarriages performed by the proper authority.\\n',\n",

In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I\\'ll\\nalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the\\nterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would\\nmean for Paul\\'s readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter\\nthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us\\nwith some of the major divisions within Christ\\'s body, and I am not trying\\nto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that\\nseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely\\ncharacterizable as \"liberal\") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\\nto reach \"closure\" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\\n\\nSo; stipulating Paul\\'s intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\\n\\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\\nCorinthians, there are two \"positive\" answers and one \"negative\" to this\\nquestion:\\n\\n+\\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\\n\\t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\\n\\t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\\n\\t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\\n\\t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\\n\\t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\\n\\n+\\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\\n\\t    what God means \"behind\" Paul\\'s inspired word-choice.)\\n\\n-\\tc.  We *don\\'t* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\\n\\t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\\n\\t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (\"those who have\\n\\t    more\" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is \"obvious\" from\\n\\t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\\n\\t    translates it as \"grabbers\") or even _methusoi_ (\"drunkards\"\\n\\t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\\n\\t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\\n\\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n_ad_ a:\\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\\n\\tcommunity of Christ\\'s disciples and their successors, and that\\n\\tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\\n\\tBut it\\'s also the case that we know little or nothing about this\\n\\ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\\n\\twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of\\n\\tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\\n\\tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.\\n\\n_ad_ b:\\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\\n\\tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\\n\\tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\\n\\tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\\n\\tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\\n\\tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\\n\\tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\\n\\ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\\n\\tunderstanding supposedly derived from the \"clear\" Word of God.\\n\\n\\t\\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\\n\\t\\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\\n\\t\\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\\n\\t\\tthe more bizarre forms of \"I will read Scripture my way\"\\n\\t\\tare primarily a fringe aspect of \"cultic\" Protestantism.]\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\\n\\tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\\n\\t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\\n\\tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\\n\\t\"convinced\" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\\n\\turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\\n\\tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?\\n\\n_ad_ c:\\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\\n\\treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\\n\\tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\\n\\tpossible. :-)\\n\\n\\t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\\n\\tone complaint against critical methodology is that it \"dissolves\"\\n\\tfaith -- but surely a \"faith\" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\\n\\tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\\n\\taddress.]\\n\\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\\n\"liberal\" and \"conservative\" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I\\npredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position\\nits due, but no more than its due. \\n\\nSecond question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of \"spiritual\"\\nChristians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,\\nthat Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against\\nmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it\\'s precisely\\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they\\'re most dangerous.\\n\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\\nand Peter and Paul do not so much \"throw out\" tradition as subject it to\\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\\n\\n     \"the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 23:23)\\nand  \"On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\\n      and the Prophets, also.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 22:40)\\n\\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus\\' reported\\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\\n\\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\\nand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from\\nlove of God and love of neighbor.\\n\\nI am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That\\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\\n\"sodomites\" as the \"cause\" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much\\ndifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick\\nto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,\\nthen I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord\\nis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,\\nfor the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.\\n\\nAnd I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel\\nsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:\\n\\n\\t\"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,\\n\\tthis movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of\\n\\tits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not\\n\\tonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves\\n\\tfighting against God.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Acts 5:36...39] \\n\\nAll I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures\\nwith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our\\nfirst Christian witnesses\\' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER\\nreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and\\nrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the\\nlove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of\\nChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to\\njudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of\\nthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who\\nare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God\\'s truth.\\n-- \\nMichael L. Siemon\\t\\tI say \"You are gods, sons of the\\nmls@panix.com\\t\\t\\tMost High, all of you; nevertheless\\n    - or -\\t\\t\\tyou shall die like men, and fall\\nmls@ulysses.att..com\\t\\tlike any prince.\"   Psalm 82:6-7\\n\\n[There\\'s a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to\\nwhether you\\'re speaking of tradition in Paul\\'s time or ours.  I think\\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That\\'s what makes me think\\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren\\'t the most\\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there\\'s\\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that\\'s rather a\\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul\\'s original\\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\\ntradition to illuminate Paul\\'s original meaning, but not use the\\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\\nhomosexuality should be.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Zhao)\\nSubject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations\\nOrganization: University of Houston\\nLines: 159\\nDistribution: world\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu\\n\\n\\n   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\\n\\nNAME\\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number.

       " 'From: Mail.Server@mozart.cc.iup.edu (mserv)\\nSubject: Ten Commandments or Ten Discourses?\\nLines: 135\\n\\nIn the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, \\nI came across something that was completely new to me, \\nand I thought I\\'d offer it for comment.\\n\\nTo keep this as brief as possible, let me state my \\nobservation as a declarative statement, and then whoever \\nwants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.  I don\\'t know if anybody has ever espoused this \\nidea before; it\\'s brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \\ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \\nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \\noffer.\\n\\n- Mark\\n',\n",

A\\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\\nACLU\\'s Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court\\'s action\\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\\n\\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school\\'s position\\nsomewhat disheartening.\\n\\nI understand rationally and logically the court\\'s position. And, I\\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\\nhand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality\\nturn into no position at all?\\n\\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\\n\\nThe other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in\\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\\n\"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the \\nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents. I\\nremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and\\nspeaking to the university students standing under a statue of\\nLenin. Now, that\\'s ironic!\\n\\nI admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths\\nhave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To\\nallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like\\natmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions\\nand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality\\nof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public\\narena acknowledges it as valid.\\n\\nHowever--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the\\ndistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our\\nschools only signals once again our culture\\'s movement away from a\\nsingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make\\nmoral and ethical decisions.\\n\\nWhat do you think? \\n\\n                         -= MAIL BOX =-\\n(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your\\nname.)\\n\\nGood column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree\\nwith moral education from home, but some homes don\\'t have the kinds\\nof morals I want taught.

Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

       " 'From: neese@cerritos.edu\\nSubject: Hell\\nDistribution: world\\nOrganization: Cerritos College, Norwalk CA\\nLines: 110\\n\\n    In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words \\ntranslated into the word \"hell\".  These Greek words have totally different \\nmeanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.\\n\\n    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the \\nNew Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...\\nmeaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be \\nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\\n\\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \\n\\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the \\ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \\nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\\n\\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \\nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \\n\"shadowy realm.\"  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \\nthis hell.\\n\\n    The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \\nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \\nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \\nreserved unto judgment...\"\\n\\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \\nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \\n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \\nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \\nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\\n\\n    Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \\nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \\nis there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\".\\n\\n    The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\"  Hinnom is a \\ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\\n\\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \\ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \\ntheir children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech.  The rites were \\nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief \\ngroves in the valley).\\n\\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \\ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later \\nthe valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for \\nsewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were \\nalso burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding \\nby a constant supply of garbage and refuse.\\n\\n    Aceldama, the \"field of blood\", purchased with the money Judas received for\\nthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.\\n\\n    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  \\n\\n    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working \\nreligious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the \\nre-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.\\nTheir fate is revealed by the apostle John: \"And the beast was taken, and with \\nhim the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire \\nburning with brimstone.\"\\n    \\n    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this \"hell\") be?\\n\\n    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: \"For \\nTophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is \\nprepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, \\nthe breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it\" (Isa.30:33).\\n\\n    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled \\nfiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).\\n\\n    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible \\nsay that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of \\nfire?\\n\\n    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be \\nthrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will \\nbecome of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? \\n \\n    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna \\nfire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This \\npunishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the \\n\"second death\" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a \\nfurther resurrection.\\n\\n    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.\\n                           \\n    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. \"For, behold, the day \\ncometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do \\nwickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...\"\\n(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be \"ashes under the \\nsoles of your feet...\"(Mal.4:3).\\n\\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \\ntorture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or \\nvalley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, \\nbut ashes!\\n \\n    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means \\ncomplete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The \\nBible says, in Romans 6:23, \"The wages of sin is death\", not eternal life in \\ntorture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of \\nlife. \\n    \\n    Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD!\\n',\n",

Is this a problem at all?\\n\\nIt is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that he\\ninterpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con-\\nsciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above\\nthat of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it\\nwrong.  Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously the\\nperceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in the\\nrealm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound.  This difficulty of\\ntranslating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been\\ndifficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies are\\nso often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemed\\nto feel that the return of the Lord was to be \"very soon\" in the sense of\\nperhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of \"very soon\" has proven to\\nbe different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescope\\ntime, so that things that are far off appear to be very close.\\n\\nAnother possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to\\nhappen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which\\nwas thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy.\\n\\nThere are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and\\nsincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming \\nevents are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these \\n\"apocalyptic\" times.  The various predictions (I\\'m talking about those that\\nappear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com-\\npletely.  One has the feeling \"something is about to start to get ready to \\nbegin to commence to happen\".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes,\\nin interesting times.\\n\\nAs for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn\\'t help much.  There is an Old\\nTestament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether\\na prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That\\nhelps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth-\\nquake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give\\nspecific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they\\nare necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions\\nare subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the\\nplane of earthly time and space.\\n\\nFor what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate \\ncould see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that \\nit would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti-\\ncipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact\\na spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate\\nis that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law,\\nknowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered\\na priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making\\ntrue predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in \\nthe way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can\\nsympathize with the person who published the prophecy.

I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)

Modern Pentecostalism was developing\\nas a predominantly \\'colored\\' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,\\nemphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and\\nindwelling of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\tMany \\'white\\' Protestant churches were growing into what became known\\nas conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was\\nin full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.\\n\\tWhen the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950\\'s and \\n1960\\'s),\\nmany \\'white\\' church groups began to be influenced by the \\'black\\' churches and\\nby what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups\\nand spread to the more conservative ones by the late \\'60\\'s.  In 1969, even the\\nCatholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other \\ngroups...still\\nevident today.\\n\\n\\tThe Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant\\ngroup.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it\\nwas generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly \\nresistant\\nto change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.\\n\\tThe magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it\\nunfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to\\ncollege students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus \\nEvangel-\\nism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,\\nplayed a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people \\nbegan\\nto speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).\\n\\tThis was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of \\nChrist.\\nIn some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or \\nfor\\nadvocating the \"Holy Spirit Movement\", another name for the new branch.  The\\nterm \"Underground Church of Christ\" also came into use because these people \\nhad\\nto hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).\\n\\tThere were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were\\nreceptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never \\nreally\\ncaught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,\\nFL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, \\nand\\nthe new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also \\nseemed\\nto put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.\\n\\tIn October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to\\nbe its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation\\'s\\n(lead) Minister.  In the late 60\\'s/early 70\\'s, the congregation worked with \\nmany\\nother groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring \\nBreak.\\nThey organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.\\nThey also worked with UF sports people.\\n\\tIn 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.\\nWhen it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer\\nappropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name\\nthat would become legendary.\\n\\n\\tBy this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs\\nwere fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn\\'t start it, they \\ncontinued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.\\n\\tBy 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that\\nthey could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal\\nproblems at Crossroads.\\n\\tCrossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require \\nattendance\\nat all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have\\nat least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of\\nyour problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer \\nPartners,\\nwhich later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The\\nleadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.\\n\\tThe book called \"The Master Plan of Evangelism\" was a strong influence\\non Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person\\'s duty\\nand life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing\\nin number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).\\n\\tA person who \"was evangelistic\" was \"spiritual\".  Evangelism meant\\ninviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them\\nconverted, then you were \"spiritual\".  There were sermons about how if you\\nbought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to\\nservices.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these\\npeople needed Jesus, you should be \"aggressive\"--don\\'t take \\'no\\' for an\\nanswer.\\n\\tIf you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called \"lazy\" or\\n\"unspiritual\".\\n\\tBy the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated \\ninto\\na structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then\\nthe group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had\\nsomeone placed over them.\\n\\tIt is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads\\nbegan to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus\\nwas tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate\\nproblem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its \"pushy\"\\nevangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ\\nto be \"dead\" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting\\nout of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.\\n\\n\\tBy this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)\\nwhere not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but\\nalso they were sending out \"planting\" [create a new church] and \\n\"reconstructing\"\\n[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the\\nCrossroads Movement was underway.\\n\\tA group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in \\nBoston,\\nMA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a\\nfraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of\\nchurch authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),\\nand not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the \\ncongregation\\nthat he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong\\nwith his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-\\none\\nChristianity.  [Called this by critics]\\n\\tIn the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want \\nto\\nbe a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into\\nthe new Boston Church of Christ.\\n\\tAh, but I\\'m ahead of myself.\\n\\tAt Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on\\nthe members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but\\nthey were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were\\ndropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership\\nbegan to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely\\n\"unproductive\" and \"unfruitful\".  The \"fruit\" passages in the NT were \\ninterpreted\\nas referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, \\nyou\\nwould be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]\\n\\tIf you love your neighbor, you\\'ll save his soul (invite him to church\\nand convert him).  If you\\'re not doing that, you don\\'t love your neighbor.\\nAnd if you don\\'t love, you\\'re in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments\\ncontinue in this vein.\\n\\tIn 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to \\nrecurring\\nsins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at\\nlarge, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  \\nFor\\nby now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most\\nCrossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should\\nbe on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]\\n\\tChuck\\'s replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the\\nBoston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer \\'training\\' \\nsessions\\nfor other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-\\nroads ready to emphasize the \"total commitment\" to the church that Boston and\\nKip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at \\nCrossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.\\nBoston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under\\nthe direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their \\nbelief\\nthat each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston \\nChurches\\nof Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since\\nCrossroads was no longer the \\'example\\' to the rest of the Movement.  The group\\nnow numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).\\n\\tThe Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary\\nelement of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called \\'Lordship\\'\\nbaptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be\\nbaptized.  You had to \\'count the cost\\'.  At Boston, they took this a step\\nfurther.  If at some time you became \"unproductive\", then your spirituality\\nwas suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you\\nwere getting into.  Anyone who said \\'no\\' had their baptism deemed invalid:  \\nthey\\nhadn\\'t counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others \\ncalled\\nthis \"rebaptism\", and Crossroads didn\\'t approve of this practice.\\n\\tWhen Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its\\nmembers left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were\\nnow called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) \\nor\\nyou were \"dead\".  They also used the nickname \"Movement of God\" for a while.\\n\\tBy Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now\\nstood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,\\nand now none in the Movement.\\n\\n\\tBoston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that\\nthey had been following.  They sent \"reconstruction teams\" to many cities, \\nwhich\\nusually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging \\nother\\nchurches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the \"remnant\".\\nThe \"remnant\" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was\\nfelt that the \"remnant\" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they\\nwould simply call their Movement \"the church\".\\n\\tThey usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the\\nother Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many\\ncampuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there\\ndue to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that\\nBoston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to \\nhave\\naccess to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed \"perse-\\ncution\", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really\\na Christian if you\\'re not being persecuted?\\n\\tThe numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have\\nfought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the\\nleaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life\\'s purpose) as\\nGod commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and\\nobedience.\\n\\n\\tCrossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the\\nCult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,\\nunder a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The\\nterm \"cult\" is usually differentiated from \"sect\" by the practice of those\\ntechniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being\\ntechniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding\\nDiscipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many\\nothers have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt \\nmotivation,\\nemotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort\\nof mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.\\n\\n\\tI have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-\\nous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a \\'falling\\nout\\' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they \\nteach.\\nI recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.\\nI hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their\\nmistakes either.\\n\\tI want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which\\nare in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much\\nvictims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys\\nmanipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel\\naccountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When\\nmembers do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel\\npersonally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.\\nThey want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.\\n\\n\\tI have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many\\nexamples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston \\nbulletins)\\nthat I could include.  But this is too long already.

First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\nit\\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\\'s certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\\'s room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\\'t rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it\\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it\\'s time and energy feeding won\\'t have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\'s heat production \\nbecause it\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary\\n-- \\nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \\nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \\n',\n",

The original letters he wrote have\\n>>long since decayed into dust.

Brian, why another excuse? \\n\\nMr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything\\nwritten in every \"historical\" document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself\\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \\n\\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\\ncarved with the Pharoah\\'s specific approval so we have true originals, rather\\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \\nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \\n\\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \\nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\\nII.\\n\\n\\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\\n\\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\\n\\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\\n\\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\\n\\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\\n\\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\\n\\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\\n\\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\\n\\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \\nbattle.)\\n\\n\\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\\n\\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\\n\\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\\n\\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\\n\\n\\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\\n\\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\\n\\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\\n\\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\\n\\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\\n\\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\\n\\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\\n\\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\\n\\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\\n\\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\\n\\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\\n\\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\\n\\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\\n\\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\\n\\t...\\n\\tI call to you, my father Amun,\\n\\tI am among a host of strangers;\\n\\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\\n\\tI am alone, there\\'s none with me!\\n\\t...\\n\\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\\n\\tAmun is more helpful than they;\\n\\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\\n\\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\\n\\n\\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\\n\\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\\n\\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\\n\\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\\n\\tHe called from behind as if near by:\\n\\t\"Forward, I am with you,\\n\\tI your father, my hand is with you,\\n\\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\\n\\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\\n\\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\\n\\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\\n\\t...\\n\\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\\n\\tNot one looked behind him,\\n\\tNot one turned around,\\n\\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\\n\\t...\\n\\tOne called out to the other saying:\\n\\t\"No man is he who is among us,\\n\\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\\n\\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\\n\\tThey are of one who is unique,\\n\\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\\n\\tCome quick, flee before him,\\n\\tTo seek life and breathe air;\\n\\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\\n\\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\\n\\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\\n\\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\\n\\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\\n\\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\\n\\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \\nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\\nwords: \\n\\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\\n\\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\\ncompletely credible. \\n\\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\\nmust be true:\\n\\n> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? \\n> Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from\\n> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer\\n> programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near\\n> complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that\\n> that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious\\n> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than\\n> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln?\\n \\nI have three points.  \\n\\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu\\'s past and\\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\\nthe testimony of Hindus:\\n\\n\\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \\n\\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \\n\\t hooey?\"\\n\\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\\npleading?\\n\\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \\n\\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\\ndeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I\\'ve\\npreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc. \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n    \"My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of \\n     salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become \\n     clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for \\n     thinking I shall ever change them.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham Lincoln\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo Judge J S Wakefield \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the death of Willie Lincoln.\\n',\n",

I\\'ve\\ntried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the\\nchord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are\\nnot key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the\\nviewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although\\nthe spatial movement seems to work fine; and I\\'m quite certain\\n- I think :) - that I\\'ve not simply made an implementation\\nerror...)\\n\\nNow I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for\\nsimilar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.\\nI\\'d appreciate replies to be emailed to me at\\n  iharkest@lise.unit.no\\nAnyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of\\nthe replies if they contact me.\\n\\n-- \\n _________     __________________\\n\\\\\\\\        \\\\\\\\  \\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ N G E  \\\\\\\\==\\\\\\\\ A R K E S T A D     iharkest@lise.unit.no         Comp.

This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim\\n1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of\\nthe Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th\\ncommandments and in the midst of this listing is \"homosexuals.\"  The decalogue,\\nabove everything else, is seen as God\\'s absolute.  If you don\\'t believe in\\nabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul\\nreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. \"Lord Christ Jesus\" transliterates to read\\n\"Jehovah\\'s Anointed Savior.\"  \\n  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan\\ngentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)\\nis not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew\\nfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for\\napplication in the NT.  As I\\'ve said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away\\nwith.\\n\\n>>of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\n>>only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\n>>wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n>>\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\n>>to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\n>>ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\n>>relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\n>>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\n>>judgements on these questions.\\n\\nThis understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being\\nposted.  Please refer to it.\\n\\n>\\n>One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\n>is because Paul probably did face this and other problems. \\n\\nWe can do better than \"probably\" which is not an adequate defense against the\\nstatement that Paul\\'s culture didn\\'t have the same understanding of\\nhomosexuality as ours.  \\nAgain read the article because it uses facts.\\n\\n>>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\n>>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.\\n>\\n>I don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.\\n\\nI think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of\\nworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application\\nof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of\\nhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who\\nis contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,\\nyet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is\\nno remorse, then I feel that Paul\\'s \"pastoral\" care, as presented in the\\nCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion\\nshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,\\nthen one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member\\nin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn\\'t\\nhesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays\\nthe present \"political correctness\" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at\\nthe present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is\\npolitically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how\\nthe morals decay.  \\n\\nI guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of\\neconomics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own\\nstates, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax\\nincentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of\\nrelativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.\\n--Rex\\n\\n[You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again.  If this is really the\\n5th through 9th commandments, we seem to be missing thieves, and\\nhomosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery.  This is of course\\npossible if \"arsenokoitia\" has a narrower meaning than homosexuality\\nin general, but I think that\\'s not your thesis.  I have no objection\\nper se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10\\ncommandments, but 5 through 9, minus one and plus a few things, begins\\nto look a bit marginal.  --clh]\\n',\n",

A.D. 388\\n\\nThere are many others.\\n\\n>As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was\\n>more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin\\n>for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)\\n\\nNo.  We have, for instance:\\n\\n    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of\\n    Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, \"the Virgin\"?\\n    ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman\\n    remains undefiled.\\n                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, \"Panacea against all heresies\",\\n                   between A.D. 374-377.\\n\\n    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine\\n    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \\n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\\n\\nNote that St. Augustine\\'s conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I\\ndon\\'t know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I\\'m quite\\nsure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary\\'s perpetual virginity originated\\nlong before Augustine\\'s time.  We hold that it originated with the \\nApostles.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, however, Mary\\'s perpetual virginity is independent\\nof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately \\nConceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin\\nand not been Immaculately Conceived.\\n\\n>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\\n>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\\n>because she did not ever sin, she didn\\'t have original sin.  When science\\n>discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\\n>Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\\n\\nNo.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original\\nsin was transmitted at conception, when a person\\'s life begins.\\nBiology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the\\ntruth of Mary\\'s sinlessness, and the means by which God could have\\nachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate\\nConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\\n\\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\\n\\n>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \\n>refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \\n>would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\\n>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\\n\\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\\nbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do\\nis enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,\\nwhich ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.\\n\\nSecond, the \"case for the doctrine\" was irreformably sealed in 1854 \\nwith the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" by\\nPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\\nbelieved by the faithful.\\n\\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most\\nthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation\\nof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never\\nclaimed that, nor shall she.\\n\\nIn Christ\\'s Peace,\\n\\nBrad Kaiser\\n(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)\\n\\n\\t  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth,\\n\\t  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love;\\n\\t  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones,\\n\\t  and His care is with His elect.\\n\\t\\t    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]\\n',\n",
